Her story begins with a standard issue “I had it all” nostalgia. Elizabeth recounts her successful practice and happy marriage, all of which are thrown into disarray by the entrance of sexy young ‘un Asa (<a href=#>Judah Lewis</a>), whose arrogance alternates with vulnerability and whose plight worms its way into Elizabeth’s head while visions of him overtaking her sexually show up supposedly unwelcome during her lovemaking sessions.</p><p>The plot thickens when Elizabeth visits Asa’s ancestral home and meets the kid’s physically weak but incredibly snide father, Ephraim (Bruce&nbsp;Davison), who cherishes a volume of ancient lore that’s filled with the kind of grotesque drawing you see in movies that have “Necronomicon” in the title. Presumably, using this volume as a guide, somebody—Asa? Ephraim? A malefactor predating both of them?—is soul-hopping from body to body. And Elizabeth is their next victim.</p><p>The subsequent hijinks don’t stint on either psychosexual perversity or gnarly violence and blood spilling. <a href=#>Heather Graham</a> relishes playing her multiple personalities. When Elizabeth is taken over by the clearly cis-het-male spirit—who can do the trick over a cell phone line, apparently—his/her relish at exploring his/her female body is practically palpable by Graham’s gyrations. Describing the joys of soul teleportation, one iteration of Asa asks Elizabeth, “Did anyone ever ask you to go f**k yourself?” and then chortles over the power to kinda-sorta do just that. And so the movie goes beyond the limits of the body-swapping shenanigans treated much more lightly in films like “Freaky Friday,” doubles down on the horndog biz offered in Gordon/Crampton’s “<a href=#>From Beyond</a>.”</p><p>The vibe here isn’t just Lovecraft and Gordon; it’s <a href=#>Charles Band</a> as well. That is, writer/director <a href=#>Joe Lynch</a> clearly worked under B-movie budget conditions, revealed in elements like lighting that accentuates the set-bound nature of much of the film (for instance, the blue of the window in Elizabeth’s office). Lynch is an inventive enough filmmaker to make this more a feature than a bug. And if by the end you’re having trouble keeping up with whose body is whose, that too is entirely deliberate, as is the movie’s disinclination to settle into a definitive view of what the reality of its entire story is. Just go with it is the best course; the head of horror froth this movie whips up is its own reward.</p><p>Available in theaters and on digital platforms starting October 27.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46srKKskZe5pnnFpZysoF2ivLe1xGapnq6ZmsRufo9rag%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
