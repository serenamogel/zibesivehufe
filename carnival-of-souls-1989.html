On a narrow wooden bridge, one of the cars crashes through a railing and plunges into the flooded river below. Police and volunteers search for the wreckage in vain, and then Hilligoss appears on a sandbar, dazed and covered with mud.</p><p>What happened to the others? How did she escape? She doesn't know. Indeed, she doesn't care. She's a brittle, cynical woman who works as a church organist but doesn't take religion seriously. That's despite the fact that the organ seems to be trying to tell her something. There is a sensational overhead shot in an organ factory, looking down past the steep and angled pipes to her diminutive figure far below, and another effective moment when she's in a car on a deserted highway and the radio only picks up organ music.</p><p>A few days after she crawls out of the river, the woman leaves town for a job playing the organ in Utah, and in one of the movie's best shots, a cadaverous face appears in the car window. It's the face of a ghostly figure who will follow her to Utah (the figure is played by the film's director, <a href=#>Herk Harvey</a>). In Utah, she checks into one of those B-movie boarding houses, presided over by the cherubic <a href=#>Frances Feist</a>. There's one other boarder, a Mr. Linden (<a href=#>Sidney Berger</a>), who is a definitive study of a nerd in lust.</p><p>Unlike most of today's horror movies, "Carnival of Souls" has few special effects - some wavy lines as we pass through various levels of existence, and that's it. Instead, it depends on crisp black-and-white photography, atmosphere and surprisingly effective acting. It's impossible to know whether this movie was seen by such directors as <a href=#>David Lynch</a> or <a href=#>George Romero</a>. But in the way it shows the horror beneath the surface of placid small-town life, it suggests "<a href=#>Blue Velvet</a>," and a shot of dead souls at an abandoned amusement park reminded me of the lurching undead in "The Night of the Living Dead."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46cmKummauurXnOn2Ssp6WhwG59mHFw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
