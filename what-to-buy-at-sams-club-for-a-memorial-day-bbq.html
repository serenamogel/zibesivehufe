I spotted more exciting versions of the items I saw at Costco, and some of the products I saw at Sam’s Club come in smaller portions so you’re not left eating the remnants of a gigantic can of Bush’s baked beans for the rest of your days on earth. I can feel my Costco membership card bursting into flames in my wallet as I write this, but I have to report the truth to my faithful readers! So, if you’re a Sam’s Club shopper, I have good news: Your summer BBQs are going to be epic. Here’s what to buy at Sam’s Club for a Memorial Day BBQ to kick things off right.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Amylu Mushroom and Gouda Chicken Burgers</strong></a><p>I’m all about adding cheffy touches to a Memorial Day BBQ, but I think it’s great to accept our limits, too. I’m not looking to top every burger I make with a mountain of ingredients like I’m freaking Applebee’s. These chicken burgers from Sam’s Club have fixins—namely mushrooms and gouda—inside the burger. Creative, mess-free, and easy to dish out. That’s a big-brain move, Sam’s Club!</p><p><strong>Read our ranking of the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-frozen-burgers/>best frozen burgers</a></strong></p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Member’s Mark Cheddar Cheese Pork Franks</strong></a><p>I looked high and low at Sam’s Club and I couldn’t find the Kirkland Signature Beef Hot Dogs anywhere?! We’ll have to improvise! Everyone loves a good <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/oscar-mayer-stuffed-dogs-review/>stuffed frank</a>, so let’s grab these as a replacement (heavy sigh of defeat). They’re perfect for the grill at your backyard BBQs, but you can cook them on the stovetop if you want that classic Costco boiled dog feel.</p><p><strong>Read our ranking of the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-hot-dogs/>best hot dogs</a></strong></p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Member’s Mark Baby Back Pork Ribs</strong></a><p>Kudos to you if you’re prepping for hours for your Memorial Day BBQ, but that could not be me. I’m skipping the smoker and getting these fully cooked ribs from Sam’s. They can even be finished up on the grill, in front of your invited audience, so, really, it’s like you’re doing most of the work with a little assistance from your sous chef, Sam. You better get a standing ovation for your hard work!</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Member’s Mark BBQ Baked Beans with Beef Brisket</strong></a><p>Sam’s Club also sells the infamous 7 lb can of <a href=# rel=noopener>Bush’s Baked Beans</a> we saw at Costco, but I also found this more manageable 2.5 lb container of their own name brand. Way better—sorry Costco! Real chunks of beef brisket (and lots of ’em, by the look of things) make me hopeful for Sam’s version. Baked beans seem like a natural fit for a BBQ, so be sure to grab this tub on your way through the deli section.</p><p><strong>Read our ranking of the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-canned-baked-beans/>best baked beans</a></strong></p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Member’s Mark Loaded Potato Salad</strong></a><p>I think a BBQ with baked potatoes would be bomb. You could have a whole spread of toppings to go along with your baked potatoes. <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-shredded-cheddar-cheese/>Shredded cheese</a>, crumbled <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-bacon/>bacon</a>, fresh chives—the whole nine yards. That also sounds like a true nightmare if I’m the one hosting though. Enter: Member’s Mark Loaded Potato Salad. All the pleasantries of a full loaded baked potato in a neat little BBQ-ready potato salad. Grab this if you share my vision of baked potatoes at the BBQ and want to give it a test run.</p><p><strong>Read our ranking of the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-store-bought-potato-salad/>best potato salad</a></strong></p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Shiner Sunday Funday Variety Pack</strong></a><p>The box says “Sun*Day,” so when I was looking around Sam’s Club I thought to myself, “This is perfect.” What says “sun day” like a Memorial Day BBQ? The whole dang party is held under the sun, and that’s why I’m including it on this list of what to buy for a Memorial Day BBQ at Sam’s Club. The pack includes cans of Shiner’s Light Blonde, Prickly Pear, and Orale (Mexican style beer), so everyone at the party should be able to find one they like.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Sensible Portions Garden Veggie Mac n’ Cheese Puffs</strong></a><p>The irony of a company called “Sensible Portions” selling a giant bag of <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-boxed-mac-and-cheese/>mac and cheese</a>-flavored puffs at Sam’s Club is a bit much in a good way. You know what else is a bit much in a good way? The flavor of mac and cheese-flavored cheese puffs, I bet. I am not buying a giant bag of these for my personal consumption (even if they do contain veggies), but a BBQ is a perfect excuse to get these. Satisfy your curiosity and feed your guests in one fell swoop.</p><p><strong>Read our ranking of the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-cheese-puffs/>best cheese puffs</a></strong></p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Otter Pops 6 Flavor Variety Pack</strong></a><p>Memorial Day is the symbolic start of summer, right? There couldn’t be a better time to buy a 200-pack of Otter Pops! You’ll get rid of maybe 30 at the BBQ, and then you’ve got three months to get through the rest. Freeze a ton before Memorial Day and help cool off your guests, then enjoy the rest as you begrudgingly sit in a pile of your own sweat as you resist the temptation of turning on your AC. Frugal (or tight-wad) win!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BYlsFuwM5mma6xXZbBbr%2FApqpmm5yqr26yzqtkmmWdmrqwvsiao2acka56o67QaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
