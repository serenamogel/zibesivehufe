Although we only see the back of his head, we can safely assume that this man is Wendigo Donner, the same man who abducted Claire at the end of season 5 (he wasn't among the men who assaulted her).<h2>How did Stephen Bonnet know about the jewels?</h2>He knows about the gems<p>Because of Jamie's help, Bonnet learns about the valuable gems.
