She is most famous for her appearance in the 1957 film noir classic Sweet Smell of Success as the sister for whom Burt Lancaster has an unhealthy affection as well as in The Twilight Zone episode "Five Characters in Search of an Exit."She is a graduate of the High School of Performing Arts in New York City, where she played Frankie in Member of the Wedding by Carson McCullers and Eliza Doolittle in George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion. She attended Boston University, briefly studying under Peter Kass, who directed her in the role of Abigail in Arthur Miller's The Crucible. Her professional debut was in the live television drama Can You Coffeepot on Skates?, presented in 1956. This was followed by television appearances on Matinee Theatre and Alfred Hitchcock Presents and her cinematic debut in Sweet Smell of Success. On October 19, 1957, she opened on Broadway at the Bijou Theater, playing "the Girl" in William Saroyan's new play The Cave Dwellers to uniformly good reviews. The following year she was in the Playhouse 90 production of In Lonely Expectation, which brought her to the attention of Rod Serling and led to her role as the ballerina in the iconic Twilight Zone episode. She had several later television and stage roles, most notably in an episode of the television show Bonanza, "Dark Star." In 1960 she played Ruby, the female lead, in the little-seen film Key Witness with Jeffrey Hunter and Dennis Hopper.By 1963 she had left public life and acting and devoted herself to family matters, though in the 1990s she played Elberta in a Jackson County Stage Company (Carbondale, Illinois) production of Mixed Couples. She has since appeared at various film and science fiction conventions. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=2><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$1.5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>August 26, 1938</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Leesburg, Florida, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5' 3" (1.6 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actress</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Cass Conger</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Nicknames</td><td>Susan Harrison, Harrison, Susan</td></tr><tr><td>Star Sign</td><td>Virgo</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=10.475535168196><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=7><td>1</td><td>Attended the 2007 Twilight Zone Convention at the Hilton Hasbrouck Heights, Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, August 4-5, 2007.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Mother of <a href=#>Darva Conger</a></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>3</td><td>(As of February 2000) She lives with her daughter in Thousand Oaks, California</td></tr><tr readability=2.928><td>4</td><td>Her daughter, <a href=#>Darva Conger</a>, married actor <a href=#>Rick Rockwell</a> on <a href=#>Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?</a> (2000) in February, 2000.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>5</td><td>Has 5 children: 4 sons, 1 daughter</td></tr><tr readability=5.6374045801527><td>6</td><td>The March 6, 2000 issue of People magazine confirmed that 1950s/60s actress Susan Harrison is the mother of <a href=#>Darva Conger</a>, the instant bride on <a href=#>Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?</a> (2000), a controversial Fox "reality-TV" program which aired on February 2000.</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Actress <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actress readability=1><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Breaking Point</td><td>1963</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Martha</td></tr><tr><td>The Twilight Zone</td><td>1961</td><td>TV Series</td><td>The Ballerina</td></tr><tr><td>Follow the Sun</td><td>1961</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Linda Tait</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Alfred Hitchcock Presents</td><td>1961</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Susan Harper</td></tr><tr><td>The Light That Failed</td><td>1961</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Maisie</td></tr><tr><td>Key Witness</td><td>1960</td><td></td><td>Ruby</td></tr><tr><td>Bonanza</td><td>1960</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Tirza</td></tr><tr><td>Playhouse 90</td><td>1959</td><td>TV Series</td><td>P.J.</td></tr><tr><td>Sweet Smell of Success</td><td>1957</td><td></td><td>Susan Hunsecker</td></tr><tr><td>Matinee Theatre</td><td>1956</td><td>TV Series</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Star Tonight</td><td>1956</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Dorsey Mitchell</td></tr></table><h3>Known for movies</h3><figure class=gallery-item readability=1><p>Sweet Smell of Success (1957)<br>as Susan Hunsecker</p></figure><figure class=gallery-item readability=1><p>Key Witness (1960)<br>as Ruby</p></figure><figure class=gallery-item readability=1><p>The Twilight Zone (1961)<br>as The Ballerina</p></figure><figure class=gallery-item readability=1><p>The Light That Failed (1961)<br>as Maisie</p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqecrWWnpL%2B1tI6srKyZnmK1or7Roqqopl2jsrV51qipraBdZ3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
