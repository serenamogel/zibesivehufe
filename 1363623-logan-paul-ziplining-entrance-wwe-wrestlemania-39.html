One performer took that mentality to new heights, quite literally, as he sailed down to the stage from a zipline. With his WWE contract coming to an end shortly after WrestleMania 39, Logan Paul made the most of his time at the grand spectacle.</p><p>Before he stepped into the ring with <a href=#>Seth Rollins,</a> the camera panned to reveal Logan Paul attached to a zipline up in the sky. Reminiscent of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shawn Michaels’ WrestleMania XII entrance</a>, Paul amazed the crowd as he descended to land on the ramp.</p><p>Recently speaking on his <a href=#>IMPAULSIVE podcast,</a> Paul revealed it was his love of flying that prompted the idea for his entrance. As he continued on, Paul admitted that it took a lot of effort, and convincing, to execute his vision.</p><p>“I love flying, which is why I requested the zip line. I requested the zip line last year at WrestleMania, my first WrestleMania ever, I said, ‘WWE, can I get a zip line in?’ They’re like, ‘Why don’t you get a match in first?’ I was like, alright, I get that. But this year, I requested the zip line again. It got denied, and I was like, ‘Hey, is it a liability thing? Can I convince them to do it? Is it an insurance thing? I’ll cover it.’</p><p>“WWE got me a zipline into SoFi Stadium for my birthday,” he said. “It took four different companies [to get it approved]. They got it all done in like a week and a half…Very, very expensive stunt. I love the WWE so much for doing this because when I was flying in the air on that zipline, I’m looking around at all these eyeballs and phones just pointed at me, and ever since I moved out to Hollywood, which is where WrestleMania took place this year, my goal was to be the biggest entertainer in the world. And g*ddamn, in that moment, I felt like the biggest entertainer in the world, at least the highest.”</p><p><a href=#>Seth Rollins: Logan Paul Proved Something To Me At WrestleMania 39</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJvam9qY2K5sLPAp2SpmaWheru1z6Wgp6GenHqmutOrmKeblWLEuLGMsKmeq6Shsq6tzaKYZmtp</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
