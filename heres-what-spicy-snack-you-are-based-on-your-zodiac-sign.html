Also, Takis are bright red and that tends to be the color of people’s faces when Aries take them down in competitions. Unfortunately, I learned this from experience.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Let’s Talk About the Best Takis Flavors</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Taurus (April 20-May 20): Doritos Tapatío</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ZODIAC_FLAMIN-HOT_TAURUS-1170x658.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tapatío Doritos </a>are perfect. They’re comforting, tangy, and spicy, and taste EXACTLY like Tapatío, just like Tauruses. Taurauses (Tauri? Tauranosaurises?) are a calming, comforting presence, but that doesn’t mean they still can’t bring the heat when it matters most. And I was kind of joking earlier, but if your Taurus friend actually smells like Tapatío, maybe tell them to shower?</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Best Doritos Flavors Ranked</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Gemini (May 21-June 20): Kettle Brand Krinkle Cut Habanero Lime</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ZODIAC_FLAMIN-HOT_GEMINI-1170x658.jpg><p>Geminis have been called many things—curious, multifaceted, a lil bit off their rockers, but have you ever heard them called Habanero Lime <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kettle Chips</a>? Hear me out y’all. Yes, Geminis might have two different sides to them, but hey, sometimes the sides work in harmony to create something even better than either facet on its own. I think Gemini’s multifaceted nature is what makes them so fun to be around, just like a habanero-lime chip. A lil crazy, sure, but just crazy enough to work? You bet. Plus sour, salty, and spicy famously go well together.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">An Updated List of the Best Kettle Chip Flavors</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Cancer (June 21-July 22): Buldak Carbonara Ramen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ZODIAC_FLAMIN-HOT_CANCER-1170x658.jpg><p>Cancers are very empathetic and sensitive people, but you wouldn’t know that when you first meet them. These <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Buldak spicy noodles</a> are the same way. The packaging looks a bit scary and unapproachable (the pink! the flames!), but these noodles are actually so comforting and cheesy (in addition to being extremely spicy), just like some Cancers I happen to know.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Every Flavor of Buldak Noodles, Ranked</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Leo (July 23-August 22): Flamin’ Hot Cheetos</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ZODIAC_FLAMIN-HOT_LEO-1170x658.jpg><p>I mean, come on. If you were making a movie about spicy snacks, who would be the main character? You know it would be miss Flamin’ Hot Cheetos. In fact, I’m pretty sure <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">they just did this</a>—Hollywood will biopic anything these days. But seriously, these Cheetos have extreme Leo energy and are very much in the spicy chip spotlight. I’d say it’s deservedly so, even though I love a lot of things on this list, I will never say no to spending some time with Hot Cheetos—and the same goes for Leos.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">We Ranked the 9 Best Cheetos Flavors</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Virgo (August 23-September 22): Spicy Dill Pickle Almonds</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ZODIAC_FLAMIN-HOT_VIRGO-1170x658.jpg><p>Virgos are busy. They don’t have time for both a spicy snack AND a snack that will keep them full all afternoon—enter spicy dill pickle almonds, the snack that does, in fact, have it all. They fill you up and they are spicy, multitasking like a Virgo, girlbossing like a champ. These almonds are unequivocally the Virgo of the spicy snacking world.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Libra (September 23-October 22): Sweet Chili Doritos</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ZODIAC_FLAMIN-HOT_LIBRA-1170x658.jpg><p>These <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Doritos</a> are phenomenal. Are they particularly spicy? No. But they are also not particularly sweet. What they actually are is balanced. No one flavor dominates the rest, creating a beautiful symphony of salt, fat, acid, heat, and sweet. They are the chip equivalent of a perfectly in tune major chord and Libras are the human equivalent of the same thing. Ugh, gorgeous.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Best Doritos Flavors Ranked</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Scorpio (October 23-November 21): Takis Blue Heat</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ZODIAC_FLAMIN-HOT_SCORPIO-1170x658.jpg><p>Scorpios can be a bit hard to read and mysterious sometimes and no spicy chip is more mysterious than Takis Blue Heat. They just leave you with so many more questions than answers. An air of mystery surrounds them. For example, who thought these were a good idea? Also, how do they get them to be that blue!? Also, is there a difference in taste from Takis Fuego or are they really and truly just the same chip in a different font color?</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Let’s Talk About the Best Takis Flavors</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sagittarius (November 22-December 21): Herr’s Jalapeño Popper Flavored Cheese Curls</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ZODIAC_FLAMIN-HOT_SAG-1170x658.jpg><p>Sagittariuses are curious and always looking to learn more about the world around them, and let me tell you, these strange little <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cheese curls</a> from Herr’s hold many cheesy, curly secrets. They are essentially Cheetos puffs, but they are as cheesy as they are spicy, to the point where they actually taste a lot like jalapeño poppers.

It is also a well-known fact that Capricorns are patient, determined, and willing to take their time with things. And while buying Flamin’ Hot BBQ chips at the store isn’t anything like slow-smoking some meat in your backyard, the flavor is reminiscent of that—smoky, tangy, and, most of all, spicy. Plus, super underrated. These ruffles are the Capricorns of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hot chips</a> for sure.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">An Updated Ranking of the Best Spicy Chips</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Aquarius (January 20-February 18): Spicy Pickles</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ZODIAC_FLAMIN-HOT_AQUARIUS-1170x658.jpg><p>I know, what? Everyone else gets to be a chip or a noodle, and Aquarius is a pickle? Yes. 100%. Just think about it— is there a more quirky, creative, or divisive food than a pickle? Nope. Is there a more quirky, creative, and divisive person than an Aquarian? Also nope.

They make me nostalgic for simpler times, when a bag of these and a bag of Swedish Fish could make my entire week (actually, let’s face it, they still could). But either way, these chips cause me to romanticize my high school experience and no one sees the world in as positive and romantic a light as Pisces. Plus, these hot fries perfectly embody the vibe of “Spicy Pisces,” and we here at Sporked love a perfectly embodied vibe.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">An Updated Ranking of the Best Spicy Chips</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKCVp7K0edahmK1lo6W2pMWMrKWam5tixrDBjJqpnmWSlsCmsIyopWaxn6q%2FbsbOnaCam12otqi6jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
