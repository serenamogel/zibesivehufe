Recently, during an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a>, Evans shared how he got the actors to make a brief appearance in&nbsp;Ghosted.&nbsp;In the discussion, Evans revealed that despite being good friends with Reynolds, Mackie, and Stan, he dislikes asking them to do cameos. The 41-year-old’s hesitation stems from having to come up with a particular way to ask.</p><p>“Well, you’ve got to do that awful thing where you hit someone up and say, ‘Hey, you want to come do a cameo on this thing?I hate asking. I hate it.”</p><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=521 data-injectable=true>Later, Evans disclosed that he “didn’t feel bad asking” Reynolds, with the help of his co-star Ana de Armas, because of the favor he extended for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the father of four’s project&nbsp;Free Guy,</a> and talked about the conversation he had to have with the three. While praising Reynolds, Mackie, and Stan for their work, he stated,&nbsp;</p><p>“Yeah, well, that’s why I didn’t feel bad asking Ryan — I did something for Ryan in&nbsp;Free Guy. But you’re still just like, ‘Sorry, do you want to do this?’ And they’re good buddies, so of course they’re going to jump in. But it’s like asking someone to pick you up from the airport. ‘I know I really don’t want to ask you to do this, but can you help me move on a Sunday?’ But yeah, they came through and they were great.”</p><p data-characters=198 data-current-count=198 data-injectable=false>Evans admitted that even though he was not comfortable asking his friends to do a cameo in his film, he was glad he did because he enjoyed working with them and “seeing all those faces.”</p><p>“It’s fun seeing all those faces. They’re old buddies, so it just kind of feels good. It’s like when your buddy does pick you up from the airport, you’re like, ‘Thanks man. Thanks for showing up.'”</p><p data-characters=43 data-current-count=43 data-injectable=false>Ghosted is now streaming on Apple TV Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomqGqmah6psLAp6pmqpWrsqK40mafqK9dnbJuw9GapaCklZl6qbXSZqScrV2XwqWwyJ6qZqGeqbxuv9Oop6mhnpx6o8WMoJ%2Boq6SasXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
