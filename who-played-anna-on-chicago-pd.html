The show’s most recent season, season 11, debuted in mid-January of 2024 to a rapt audience, some of whom are still reflecting on years-old storylines. Like the one that revolves around Anna Avalos, for example. Anna was a standout among viewers and quickly became a daughter figure of sorts to the popular Voight ahead of her untimely departure from the series.</p><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=239 data-injectable=false>She may no longer be a part of Chicago P.D., but Anna certainly left her mark. Fans still reflect fondly on the character, and — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">as season 11 ramps up</a> — are naturally wondering which talented star brought the popular character to life.</p><h2 id=h-the-actor-behind-chicago-p-d-s-anna-avalos data-injectable=false>The actor behind Chicago P.D.‘s Anna Avalos</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Carmela-Zumbado-Chicago-P.D..jpg><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=245 data-injectable=false>Anna Avalos was portrayed across season 9 of Chicago P.D. by American actress Carmela Zumbado. The stunning actress leans on her Colombian and Cuban heritage in many of her roles, including Anna, who is broadly labeled as “Hispanic.”</p><p data-characters=482 data-current-count=727 data-injectable=true>Zumbado is largely best known as Delilah Alves in Netflix’s You, which she starred in alongside series lead Penn Badgley. She was a standout in the show’s second season and quickly established herself as a star on the rise. That role was far from her first, but it was one of her earliest leads in a series. It helped launch her into more central future castings, and may have aided her in securing several high profile roles — including Anna — in the ensuing years.</p><p data-characters=181 data-current-count=181 data-injectable=false>After her stint on You was complete, Zumbado went on to enjoy guest roles on The Magicians, the revamped iCarly, and The Rookie before she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cinched her recurring role in Chicago P.D</a>.</p><p data-characters=193 data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false>Fresh off that success, she was cast in a leading role in season 2 of Power Book IV: Force, another crime drama. She plays Mireya Garcia in the series and will likely see a return in season 3.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMqaOasZWZeqK6zZpkqKZdmLWqr8CgpmaolGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
