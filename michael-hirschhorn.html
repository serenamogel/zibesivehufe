More than a dozen programs are now being made by Ish, including “Brooklyn 11223,” which will debut this spring on Oxygen, and “Styled by June,” which debuted this month on VH1. The first season of “All About Aubrey” just wrapped up on Oxygen, and “I Do Over” just debuted on WE, where “Fix My Family” will run later this year.</p><p>For Oxygen and Style, new seasons of the series are now in development. Additionally, there are almost two dozen projects in various stages of production for a variety of platforms, including MTV, BBC America, Lifetime, Sundance, and CBS Distribution. Ish recently signed a deal with MTV Networks, and as part of that deal, it produced several series for MTV, including “Gone Too Far,” an 8-part documentary about youth and drug addiction, which starred the recently deceased Adam “DJ AM” Goldstein; “Road To Redemption,” a series that followed the rapper T.I. for a year before serving a jail term for gun possession; “The Money and Power,” a series starring the rapper 50 Cent in which Antonio Sabato Jr. is the star of “My Antonio,” a reality dating program that aired on VH1 in 2009.</p><p>Hirschhorn is a co-founder and chief creative officer of Iconic Entertainment, which Ish Entertainment invests in and collaborates on production for. Iconic obtained commitments for three channels as part of YouTube’s new made-for-web initiative: MyIsh, a music discovery channel; 123UnoDosTres, a Latin youth culture and music channel; and Life + Times, a collaborative effort with Jay-Z. Ish Digital also creates a variety of projects for other made-for-web channels and contributes video content to Dow Jones’ new YouTube channel.</p><p>Hirschorn formerly oversaw programming at VH1, where he doubled ratings during a four-year period, helping the network’s income to more than triple. Hirschorn established the documentary shingle “VH1 Rock Docs,” which produced numerous award-winning documentaries about music and youth culture, both present and past, and was in charge of hundreds of hours of programming, both scripted and unscripted. Hirschorn received an Emmy for best documentary in 2008 for “DMC: My Adoption Journey.” In addition, he served as the executive producer of Lionsgate’s theatrical documentary “The U.S. Versus John Lennon,” which was distributed both domestically and abroad.</p><p>As a contributing editor at the Atlantic Monthly, the former journalist and magazine editor (New York Magazine, Esquire, Spin) has continued to investigate the transformative effects of digital media. Recent columns predicted the futures of print media, television, and music, and in 2009 he received harsh criticism for predicting the doom and gloom of the New York Times, which is now accepted as conventional wisdom and used as the basis for the theatrical documentary “Page One”.</p><p><strong>Also Read :</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Noah Bookbinder Wikipedia, Wiki, Biography, Parents, Bio, Age, Wife</a></li><li><a href=#>Diana Deets Wikipedia, Wiki, Obituary, Funeral</a></li><li><a href=#>Raffaello Follieri Wikipedia, Wiki, Net Worth, Age, Wife, Birthday, Documentary</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmignpe0tnrNnqtopZmYtaKxy2afoqqjmLWpu9GnZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
