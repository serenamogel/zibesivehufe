Doc is the current National Basketball Association head coach of the Philadelphia 76ers (NBA).</span></h3><p>While enrolled at Milwaukee’s Marquette University in 1979, the two first became friends. The source claims that Doc suggested Kristen wash her hair occasionally to start the conversation.</p><p>When they didn’t click immediately away, Doc set up a meeting between Kristen and one of his pals. Before Kristen and Doc started their new romantic relationship, the two of them dated each other for ten years. They were engaged and eventually married in 1986.</p><p>Doc is black and Kristen is white. They had a lot of issues in their early relationship while they were still falling in love. Because it was taboo to date people of different races at the time, they frequently encountered racist remarks. The Orlando Sentinel said that at the time Kristen’s tires were cut and her parent’s home was spray painted.</p><p>The mistreatment affected his performance. They were able to keep in touch despite the abuse and challenges. Apart from that, Doc encountered racism while playing for the Clippers. At Kristen and Doc’s San Antonia residence, where they resided with their kids, a suspicious fire started. Racial hostility was believed to have been the catalyst for the fire.</p><p>After more than three decades of marriage, the couple is getting a divorce. They have reportedly been apart for around six years, and for the past three years, they have been going through a divorce. Doc, on the other hand, hasn’t disclosed his romantic life.</p><p>Four children, Austin, 28, Callie Rivers, 32, Jeremiah, 32, and youngest son Spencer, 25, make up Kristen’s happy family. All of her boys play professional basketball, and her daughter Callie plays volleyball, making all of her kid’s athletes. While Jeremiah played basketball at Georgetown and Indiana before joining the Maine Red Claws, Austin played professionally with the National Basketball Association’s (NBA) New York Knicks. Spencer is now a UC Irvine guard.</p><h2><span id=The_lavish_wedding_of_her_daughter>The lavish wedding of her daughter</span></h2><p>Her daughter Callie wed Seth Curry, a pro basketball player for the Philadelphia 76ers, on September 14, 2019. In Malibu, there was a lovely wedding that was followed by a sizable party.</p><p>The one-year-old daughter of Callie and Seth, along with Riley and Ryan, two nieces of NBA player Steph Curry, served as flower girls for the wedding. The event becomes more thrilling when the bride and groom start dancing. The top man was Steph Curry.</p><h2><span id=Who_is_Doc8217s_mysterious_girlfriend>Who is Doc’s mysterious girlfriend?</span></h2><p>Despite the news of their approaching divorce, Doc appeared to have found a new woman in his life. Doc wrapped his arms around the waist of his new love outside the San Vicente Bungalows in Los Angeles. The identity of his new mystery girlfriend has not been made public, though.</p><h2><span id=Net_value>Net value</span></h2><p>As of November 2022, Kristen Rivers’ net worth was roughly $2 million. Doc enjoys a prosperous career as a coach. Since 1999, he has been the team’s head coach. He started as a coach for the Orlando Magic before moving on to the Boston Celtics.</p><p>He was the Boston Celtics’ head coach when they won the NBA championship in 2008. Before taking over as the head coach of the Philadelphia 76ers on October 3rd, 2020, he served as the head coach of the Los Angeles Clippers from 2013 to 2020.</p><p>He got a five-year, $40 million contract with Philadelphia as a basketball player and coach (his annual salary with the Clippers was $10 million); which equates to around $8 million per year.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Eniko Hart And Her Parents, Especially Her Mother, Are Very Close</a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Basketball Coach</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Jacque Vaughn</a></h3>Jacque Vaughn estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
