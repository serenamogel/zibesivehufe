In their role as designated healers, Clerics shoulder the responsibility of safeguarding and nurturing their companions. Yet, amidst their dedication to the well-being of others, a question arises: who watches over and shields the Clerics themselves? This is where the efficacy of Guardian of Faith comes into play.</p>Article continues below advertisementArticle continues below advertisement<p>Manifesting the essence of this spell empowers Clerics to evoke a spectral ally, a warden of sorts, entrusted with the defense of either the Cleric or their comrades. This guardian materializes in a spectral form, poised in proximity to the caster throughout the spell's duration.</p><p>Equipped with a gleaming sword and an impervious shield, this ethereal sentinel springs into action when confronted with hostile entities, acting as a stalwart bulwark against impending threats.</p><p>The guardian's purpose crystallizes when any malevolent being, intent on harm, approaches within a 10-foot radius of this spectral protector for the first instance within a given turn. At this juncture, the guardian's magical prowess comes to the fore, compelling the hostile creature to engage in a trial of dexterity.</p>Article continues below advertisementArticle continues below advertisement<p>A Dexterity saving throw ensues, a test of agility and nimbleness against the guardian's aura of radiant energy. In the event of the creature faltering in this trial, its resilience crumbles, and it succumbs to a searing assault of 20 radiant damage, a manifestation of the guardian's righteous and brilliant might.</p><p>The spell's merit extends beyond its defensive potency. It diverges from other incantations by not requiring the caster's unyielding focus, freeing the Cleric to channel their energy into healing pursuits while entrusting the guardian to dutifully fulfill its protective mandate.</p><p>Moreover, the incantation's execution necessitates merely the verbal aspect of spellcasting, thereby circumventing the constraints of combat scenarios or even instances of disarming. However, it's essential to note that the guardian's vigour is not inexhaustible; after administering 60 points of damage, it fades away, a testament to its tenacious spirit in combat yet prompting the Cleric to wield their strategic acumen judiciously when summoning this spectral shield.</p>Article continues below advertisementArticle continues below advertisement<p>In summation, Guardian of Faith thrives as an embodiment of the Cleric's dual role as both healer and guardian. A bastion of radiant defense, it conjures forth a guardian spirit sworn to protect its caster and allies against the encroaching forces of darkness.</p><p>With an unerring sword and an indomitable shield, it wards off adversaries, radiating searing luminescence that punishes those who dare oppose it. As the Cleric tends to the wounds and well-being of their companions, this spell remains an unerring sentinel, watching over the healer in their noble quest to shield and sustain.</p><h2>Guardian of Faith Baldurs Gate 3 Walkthrough</h2><p>In Baldur's Gate 3, the Guardian of Faith spell is a potent level 4 conjuration ability that summons an immobile yet powerful guardian to safeguard your allies.
