This is the case for young Jack Oscar Statham, the son of Jason Statham and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley – who shot to modeling fame almost instantly after starting her career at the age of 16. The unlikely news of their romance was greeted with a bit of shock due to the age difference between them.</p><p>However, fans quickly warmed up to the British couple and they are now one of the hottest couples at red carpet events and fashion shows. They are quite private with their son, but as always, that has not stopped the growing interest from their fans. Jack Oscar Statham is now one of those celebrity kids that the media is ever itching to get details on.</p><p>Profile Summary of Jack Oscar Statham</p><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Jack Oscar Statham</li><li><strong>Born:</strong> June 24, 2017</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 6</li><li><strong>Star Sign:</strong> Cancer</li><li><strong>Parents:</strong> Jason Statham and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley</li><li><strong>Grand-parents:</strong> Charles Andrew Huntington-Whiteley, Barry Statham, Eileen Yates Statham, Fiona Huntington-Whiteley</li></ul><h2><strong>Jack Oscar Statham Is Now 6 Years Old</strong></h2><p>It seems like just yesterday when his mother posted a black-and-white photo of him on Instagram to announce his birth and today, Statham is 6 years old. Jason and Rose’s first child was born on the 24th of June 2017.</p><p>It was a while after his parents went public with their romance that his mother, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley took to Instagram to announce that she was pregnant. In a photo of her relaxing by the beach and sporting a cute baby bump, Rose announced that she was very happy to share with her 14 million followers that she and Jason were expecting. She credited Jason with the snap.</p><p>This revelation came in February of 2017 and in the subsequent months that followed, Rose made pregnancy look ever so alluring by rocking cute outfits and showing up with her tough guy beau in hand at red carpet events in the industry.</p><p>By March of 2017, the Victoria Secret beauty had a baby shower that had somewhere between 40 to 50 family and friends in attendance. An E-News source reported the event at the time, saying that the spotlight at the event was on the preggy Rose who made sure to look very stunning for the celebration.</p><p>Unlike most baby showers where the couple reveals the baby’s gender, this was not so for Jason and Rose who kept the sex of the baby a secret by choosing to decorate the venue with neutral colors. The couple was the only ones in the know of what sex they were having and chose to keep it a family secret. The menu for the occasion was healthy snacks!</p><p>Fast forward to June of 2017, Rose took to Instagram to reveal that they had a baby boy, writing – “Our little man arrived.” She revealed that the boy whom they had named Jason Oscar Statham weighed a healthy 8.8 lbs.</p><h2><strong>Jack Oscar Statham’s Parents Met At A Party In London</strong></h2><p>The love story of Jack Oscar Statham’s parents dates back to 2009 when they met at a party in London. Rose at the time was 23 years old and as the story goes, there was instant chemistry between them and they immediately fell in love.</p><p>Though theirs was love at first sight, the couple who at the time were already famous names in the entertainment world decided to keep their romance off the public eye. It was not until years had passed that they began making public appearances together as a couple.</p><p>When their relationship became official, the first thing that was quick to become a topic of discussion was the huge age gap between the couple. While Jason was born in 1967, Rose was born in 1987, putting a huge 20-year gap between them. Notwithstanding, this has not seemed to mar their relationship in any way.</p><p>Jason Statham has made a name for himself in the movie industry and is known for his roles in action movies. The English actor got his first taste of fame acting in fellow British Guy Ritchie’s movies Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch released in 1998 and 2000, respectively.</p><p>He would then receive wide acclaim for his role in the Transporter trilogy (2002–2008). He solidified his place in Hollywood with successful films like The Italian Job, Crank, War, The Bank Job, The Mechanic, and Spy among others. In recent years, his successful works have included The Expendables, and the Fast & Furious franchise.</p><p>Jack Oscar Statham’s dad, like his mom, has experience in the modeling world. When he was younger, Jason Statham recreationally practiced Chinese martial arts, kickboxing, and karate, and subsequently went into professional diving and even represented England at the 1990 Commonwealth Games.</p><p>Years of such physical activities sculpted Jason’s body and he was encouraged to go into modeling which he did, working in various ad campaigns for big brands such as French Connection, Tommy Hilfiger, and Levi’s.</p><p>One can imagine that Jason’s early conversation with Rose included them sharing their experiences in the modeling industry. Jack’s mom began modeling straight from secondary school at the age of 15. By the age of 16, she was already booking big jobs including a modeling session for Levi’s denim.</p><p>By 2006, she signed with Victoria’s Secret and has since been on the rise. Some other big brands she has represented include Burberry and Marks & Spencer. She has also dabbled into acting and is known for her roles in Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011) and Mad Max: Fury Road (2015).</p><h3><strong>The Parents Are Yet To Get Married</strong></h3><p>Jack Oscar Statham’s parents got engaged in 2016. Before the couple made the announcement, reporters spotted what looked like an engagement ring on Rose’s finger during one of the couple’s red carpet appearances. The couple subsequently broke the news to fans, however, it seemed as though a wedding was not in the works.</p><p>Rose has spoken of their long engagement, saying that they are in no hurry to get married but are instead focused on building their respective careers. This has not made Jason Statham less involved with his daddy duties.</p><p>Rose described Jason as a “brilliant dad” to the media, revealing that he is often happy to be up at 5 am and get right to taking care of the baby while letting her catch an extra hour of sleep in the mornings.</p><p>Rose told the media that instead of running to the altar that she and Jason were planning to make another baby, and they are. In August 2021, it was <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>reported</a> that she was expecting baby number 2. She told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Pop Sugar</a> that after the second baby arrives, then they could hold a wedding with their kids in attendance.</p><h2><strong>Does Jack Oscar Statham Have an Instagram Account?</strong></h2><p>Jack Oscar Statham’s parents have taken turns to gush about him to the media, but one thing they are wary of is revealing their son’s full identity to the public. Rose once <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>told the media</a> that she was obsessed with her son and that she had never been so in love her whole life. She does occasionally post photos of her son on Instagram but does so on her own page and not Jack’s.</p><p>In those photos, Rose is always careful not to show more than Jack’s profile, often avoiding showing his full face. For parents who are that private with sharing their son’s photo, having an Instagram account in their son’s name is a no-no, so no, Jack Oscar Statham has no official Instagram account.</p><p>However, a certain fan seemed to be so obsessed with young Jack that they have created an Instagram account in his name where they repost photos that Rose posts on her page as well as paparazzi shot of the mom or dad taking him on a walk. Paparazzi cameras have been able to take photos showing Jack’s full face.</p><p><img decoding=async fetchpriority=high src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/11/jack-statham.jpg alt="Jack Oscar Statham" width=962 height=490 sizes="(max-width: 962px) 100vw, 962px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Rose might be skeptical about showing Jack’s full face but she has spoken of how he is like to the media.
