The tragic incident has left the family of Morris mourning the loss of their loved one, while Smith faces the possibility of spending the rest of her life behind bars.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Background of the Incident</h2><p>According to reports by the Louisville Police Department, an officer was patrolling the area near Wildwood Park when an individual flagged him down and reported that there had been a stabbing in the park.&nbsp;</p><p>Upon arriving at the scene, first responders found Morris, who appeared to be suffering from a stab wound to the chest. Attempts to save Morris’s life were unsuccessful, and he died shortly after arriving at the hospital.</p><p>The incident involved a knife and resulted from an altercation between the two groups of teenagers. The altercation involved multiple juveniles and reportedly stems from previous unresolved conflicts between some of those involved.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Arrests and Trials</h2><p>Immediately after the incident, the police arrested Marissa Grace Smith and a 15-year-old male. The now 16-year-old was charged as a juvenile and is awaiting trial, which is scheduled to begin in June 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>He has pleaded not guilty to juvenile counts of murder, felonious assault, aggravated criminal trespass, and carrying a concealed weapon.</p><p>Meanwhile, Smith’s trial concluded earlier this month with the jury finding her guilty of one count of felony murder and one count of felonious assault.&nbsp;</p><p>Stark County Common Pleas Judge Natalie Haupt on Monday ordered Smith to serve a sentence of life in prison with the possibility for parole in 15 years.</p><p><strong>Keep reading</strong></p><p>During Smith’s trial, witnesses testified that a group of male and female teenagers had met each other in the park and planned to fight.&nbsp;</p><p>During the altercation, Smith took the knife out of the waistband of her co-defendant and began moving towards Morris while screaming at him, several witnesses reportedly testified.&nbsp;</p><p>Smith and several of her friends who testified reportedly told the jury that Morris then “pulled” Smith towards him and essentially “walked into” the blade.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Victim Impact Statement and Sentencing</h2><p>At Smith’s sentencing hearing, one of Morris’ family members, Tara Burns, read a victim impact statement aimed directly at Smith, who was sitting just a few feet away from the podium.&nbsp;</p><p>Burns expressed her grief and anger towards Smith and highlighted Morris’s ordeal and the impact of his death on the family.</p><p>Judge Haupt also spoke to the court before handing down the sentence, acknowledging the tragedy of Morris’ death while also considering the mandatory minimum required under state law.</p><p><strong>“I’m sure there are a lot of regrets that Ms. Smith has. But those mistakes cost Michael Morris his life, and this court is required to impose a sentence of 15 years to life,”</strong> Judge Haupt said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Conclusion</h2><p>The tragedy that occurred in Wildwood Park highlights the devastating consequences of violence and young people carrying weapons.&nbsp;</p><p>It has left the Morris family devastated and ended the prospect of a bright future for Smith. The incident is a warning that resolving conflicts through violence is never an acceptable solution and can have fatal consequences.&nbsp;</p><p>As the trial of the 15-year-old male co-defendant continues, it is crucial to ensure justice is served to both Morris and his family and any other parties involved in this tragic incident.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC5wKugrKuRYsCutdOhZKatopmys3nTq5igoZNitq%2BvyJ2cp6xdoby2tdKvoKWklWK9or7KaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
