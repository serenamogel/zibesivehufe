Recommended Videos Biel and Olsen respectively played the now-therapist and accused killer in separate mini-series’ titled Candy and Love & Death. Biel’s show Candy premiered on Hulu in 2022, while Love & Death starring Olsen debuted on HBO Max this year. Despite the shows’ differences, their central premise follows Montgomery’s life as a housewife and mother in Wylie, Texas. 
Things took a tragic turn in June 1980 when Montgomery and her best friend, Betty Gore, got into an argument over her affair with Gore’s husband, Allan Gore, which ultimately led to the death of the elementary school teacher."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Stories that are interesting deserve to be told and every way you’re going to tell it, it’s gonna be different. It’s impossible for it to be the same. I think it was more just kind of like, ‘Oh, great. This is nice that we are both acknowledging this thing because we were filming simultaneously. That was a big shock to all of us that there was another show being made when we were already filming.
