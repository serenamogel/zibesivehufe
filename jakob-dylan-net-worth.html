When he was three his family moved to Los Angeles, and he became interested in music thanks to listening to his older brother’s records, particularly The Clash. During his high school days, Dylan was involved with a few bands, including the Bootheels, where he met his future band member Tobi Miller.</p><p>After graduating from high school, Dylan went on to study art at the Parsons School of Design, but dropped out after one semester to pursue a career in music. He and Tobi Miller formed the band called the Apples in 1989, but later renamed it to The Wallflowers and signed a deal with Virgin Records. Their self-titled debut album came out in 1992, but did not do well commercially, with only around 40,000 copies sold.</p><p>In the next few years they toured with bigger bands, and moved from Virgin Records to Interscope Records through which their second album called “Bringing Down the Horse” was released in 1996, which achieved quadruple platinum status and is their highest-selling release to date; it topped the Billboard Heatseekers chart, peaked at No. 4 on The Billboard 200 and reached No. 6 on Canadian Albums chart.
