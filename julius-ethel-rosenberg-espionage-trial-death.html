Their time at high school intersected briefly – Ethel was nearly three years older – but they became acquainted through their devotion to the Young Communist League and were married in 1939.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Julius became a civilian engineer with the U.S. Army Signal Corps and cut formal ties with communist organizations, but by late 1942 he was working with Soviet intermediaries to relay military secrets to the then-American ally.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">By 1945, he had assembled an espionage ring of engineers, scientists and machinists that included his old City College classmate Morton Sobell. It also included his brother-in-law David Greenglass, who was then involved with the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/the-manhattan-project data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Manhattan Project" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Manhattan Project</a> – the creation of the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/atomic-bomb-history data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="atomic bomb" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">atomic bomb</a> – at a facility in Los Alamos, New Mexico.</p><img alt="Ethel and Julius Rosenberg following their arrest by the FBI in New York City for espionage, 1950." title="Ethel and Julius Rosenberg following their arrest by the FBI in New York City for espionage, 1950." width=3594 height=3600 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1197146285.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-wuot6e e1geg53v2">Ethel and Julius Rosenberg following their arrest by the FBI in New York City for espionage, 1950.; Photo: Kypros/Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">The apprehension of a British spy set off a string of arrests</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The first shoe to drop in the case came with the arrest of German-born British physicist Klaus Fuchs on February 2, 1950. Fuchs had also worked at Los Alamos and passed along information to the Soviets independently of the Rosenbergs, though they shared a crucial link with their courier, Harry Gold.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In May the FBI hauled in Gold, who pointed his finger at another common denominator, Greenglass. The dominoes continued to fall with Julius' apprehension in July and Ethel's arrest in August, with Sobell discovered to be hiding in Mexico at that time.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After Greenglass pleaded guilty, the trial for the Rosenbergs and Sobell began on March 6, 1951, in the Southern District of New York. Making little attempt to portray himself as impartial, Judge Irving R. Kaufman opened the proceedings by declaring: "The evidence will show that the loyalty and alliance of the Rosenbergs and Sobell were not to our country, but that it was to Communism."</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Greenglass provided crucial testimony against the Rosenbergs</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The case against the Rosenbergs largely hinged on the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/atom-spy-caserosenbergs data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=testimonies class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">testimonies</a> of Gold and Greenglass. Gold recalled how he had met Greenglass in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in June 1945, with the passcode "I come from Julius." After each confirmed the shared allegiance by producing a "passport" of a cut-off Jell-O box top, Gold paid $500 for information on the atomic bomb.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Greenglass testified that the Rosenbergs began lobbying his wife, Ruth, to get her husband involved in the espionage ring by November 1944. He returned to New York City on furlough in January 1945, at which point he showed Julius his notes and a sketch of a high-explosive lens.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Even more damning, Greenglass described another meeting at the Rosenbergs' New York City apartment in September 1945, during which time Ethel typed up his shoddy, hastily scribbled notes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To this point, the government's case against Ethel was largely nonexistent; now, her brother had portrayed her as a willing co-conspirator. Chief prosecutor Irving H. Saypol leaped all over this account, dramatically telling the jury how she "sat at that typewriter and struck the keys, blow by blow, against her own country in the interests of the Soviets."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Julius and Ethel took the stand in their defense, but other than denying the charges, they largely evoked the Fifth Amendment on matters of espionage and their involvement in the Communist Party, their silence amplifying the testimony against them.</p><img alt="Ethel and Julius Rosenberg at the courthouse" title="Ethel and Julius Rosenberg at the courthouse" width=3762 height=3042 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-515384968-1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-wuot6e e1geg53v2">Ethel and Julius Rosenberg at the courthouse; Photo: Bettmann/Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Albert Einstein and the Pope led calls for clemency</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On March 29, 1951, the jury returned a verdict of guilty against the trio charged. Judge Kaufman imposed the death penalty on Julius and Ethel, telling them, "I consider your crimes worse than murder." He spared the life of Sobell, who was not involved in the passage of atomic secrets and sentenced him to 30 years in prison.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A death sentence, especially for the parents of two young boys, became a major source for debate, with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/scientists/albert-einstein data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Albert Einstein" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Albert Einstein</a> and Pope Pius XII among the influential figures who urged the U.S. government to show mercy. However, the legal appeals and requests for clemency, to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/harry-s-truman data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="President Truman" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">President Truman</a> and then-<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/dwight-d-eisenhower data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="President Eisenhower" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">President Eisenhower</a>, all fizzled.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After a last-minute stay of execution was overturned, on June 19, 1953, Julius and Ethel were electrocuted at Sing Sing Prison in Ossining, New York, making them the first American civilians to be executed for espionage during peacetime.</p><h2 data-node-id=30 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Greenglass later admitted to lying on the stand</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The case remained a source of intrigue for scholars who argued about the evidence against the Rosenbergs, the clear bias of the presiding judge and the harshness of the verdict.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But there were more twists to be uncovered. In 1995, the National Security Agency released a half-century-old trove of decrypted Soviet messages from the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nsa.gov/news-features/declassified-documents/venona/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Venona Project" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Venona Project</a> which provided clear evidence of Julius' espionage.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Four years later, Sam Roberts' The Brother: The Untold Story of the Rosenberg Case contained new bombshells from the reclusive Greenglass, including the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/15/us/david-greenglass-spy-who-helped-seal-the-rosenbergs-doom-dies-at-92.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=admission class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">admission</a> that his wife possibly typed up the notes during the infamous September 1945 meeting, and that he told a different story on the witness stand to protect his immediate family.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The release of grand jury testimony in 2008 seemingly confirmed that account, while also providing inconsistencies between what Gold said in private and in public. That year, Sobell also <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/12/nyregion/12spy.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="went on record" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">went on record</a> to confess to his and Julius' involvement with the Soviets, though he insisted that his colleague's information was useless to the Eastern power, and that Ethel was guilty only of "being Julius' wife."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The various revelations have prompted the Rosenbergs' surviving sons, Michael and Robert Meeropol, to launch an effort to have their mother formally exonerated. They were unable to win over <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/barack-obama data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="President Obama" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">President Obama</a>, but there may be more chapters to come in this long-running Cold War saga.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiaq6GdmnyrwcuirKxllam1priMq6asnZ6XsrOzjJ6qqaGfo66osYytqaKZnGKxpq3ToQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
