She had a prior athletic background, so golf came relatively quickly to her.</p><p>Fowler&nbsp;received assistance&nbsp;from an instructor for an error at a nearby shooting range. She knew she still wanted to compete until she got to Cal State Fullerton after graduating high school.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=her-skills-earned-her-praise-from-coaches></span>Her Skills Earned Her Praise From Coaches<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Neil Walton, a Titan assistant coach who coaches the women’s golf team, started at shortstop for the Titans’ 2004 national championship squad.</p><p>He returned to school to help athletes with their mental games and earned a bachelor’s degree in sports psychology.

She said that it is undoubtedly a motivator, but she wasn’t sure if she would continue playing golf when she graduates and waited till she was a senior before making a decision.</p><p>Moreover, Fowler had the fourth-best scoring average on the team during the 2009–10 campaign. Her successes from the 2013 autumn included being in the top five in an invitational and going under par in another competition.</p><p>Her major is business, but she hasn’t decided on a focus. According to&nbsp;Daily Titans, she hoped that the golf industry’s business model would benefit from her business studies in the future.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=taylor-fowlers-golf-career-with-the-titans></span>Taylor Fowler’s Golf Career With The Titans<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>For the Titans’ resurgent women’s golf program in 2009–10, Taylor participated in 19 rounds spread over seven competitions, with an 81.6 team scoring average (1,550 strokes).</p><p>Her best performance came in a tie for ninth place at the&nbsp;Cal State Bakersfield Spring&nbsp;Invitational on March 22–23, and her best round came on March 1 at the Fresno State Lexus Classic with a score of 70.</p><figure></figure><p>At the 2010 Big West Conference Championships, she shot a 34-over par 250, good for 28th place overall and the second-best score by a Titan.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=she-was-the-titans-top-scorer-in-2010-11></span>She Was The Titans Top Scorer In 2010-11<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Taylor, who competed in all&nbsp;ten tournaments&nbsp;and led the Titans in scoring with an average of 79.36, finished seventh at the Firestone Grill Invitational(17 over par) in Nipomo, California, in October.</p><p>She finished third in the dual match against Cal State Bakersfield with a 76 and tied for ninth at the Bobcat Invitational (11 over par 153) in Bozeman, Montana, and the Colby Invitational (12 over par 156) in San Jose.</p><figure></figure><p>Similarly, she shot a 74 in both the first round of the Folino Invitational in March and the first competition of the year, the Bobcat Invitational, both in September.</p><p>In August 2011, at the Hooters Tourney in Georgia, she and Deidre Crabtree collaborated to tie for 17th place out of 55 teams.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=taylor-fowler-turned-31-this-april></span>Taylor Fowler Turned 31 This April<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Rickie Fowler’s sister, Taylor, is currently 31 years of age.
