In 2016, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.</p><p class=dh>Abdul-Jabbar is known to be notoriously private about his personal life, and so much is not known about his family. However, he was once married to Habiba Abdul-Jabbar (born Janice Brown). They shared three children, daughters Habiba and Sultana, and son Kareem Jr.</p><p class=dh>In 1978, Abdul-Jabbar and Janice ended their marriage. He went on to father another son, Amir, with Cheryl Pistono. He has another son, Adam, from another relationship.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR'S CAREER</strong></p><p class=dh>Abdul-Jabbar first gained national recognition while playing for UCLA from 1966 to 1969.

During his time with the Lakers, he won an additional 5 NBA championships and established himself as one of the <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/292078-is-kareem-abdul-jabbar-the-greatest-basketball-player-ever>greatest NBA players</a> of all time.</p><p class=dh>Despite retiring more than three decades ago, Abdul-Jabbar remains the NBA's all-time leader in points scored (38,387), field goals made (15,837), and career wins (1,074). He also ranks third in rebounds (9,394) and blocked shots (3,189).</p><p class=dh>In 1995, Abdul-Jabbar was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Despite his incredible career achievements, the father of five would prefer to be remembered for his off-court contributions.<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://hbr.org/2012/01/kareem-abdul-jabbar> In his words:</a></p><p class=dh>"I know I'll be remembered for the things I did on the basketball court. But I hope people will also see that, with my books and my film, I was multidimensional, and somebody who should be respected."</p><p class=dh>Since his retirement, Abdul-Jabbar has served in various capacities, including as a coach and broadcaster. Outside basketball, he has authored several books and worked in the entertainment industry. Today, he continues to inspire many with his selfless attitude and stand against racial injustice.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtqbG9mbHqsrdGenKZlkZextriMo5ibmpGneqS7za%2Bcq6yVmXqqv8uapGaclZiub7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
