And that part of 62 is 60 miles an hour, so you can imagine how devastating that is,” said Bick.</p><p>Bick and others sprung into action.</p><p>“Pulling people out of cars, doing CPR, kneeling on gravel in 90-degree heat in the sun. Relentlessly doing CPR on this poor girl.”</p><p>“These people that stopped didn’t know who these kids were. None of them were from around here. But they all stopped to help.”</p><p>But the hard work could not save 20-year-old Abigail Cox.</p><p>“I was like, this cannot be happening and it was just out of the blue,” said Kanakuk camper Kelsie Hightower.</p><p>Kelsie Hightower just got home from a two-week stay at Kanakuk camp. It’s where Cox served as a camp counselor.</p><p>“She was really just an amazing person, even just the two weeks I’ve known her. You can just see how amazing a person she was and she just put so so much joy into camp and just helping other people,” said Hightower.</p><p>Kanakuk says the other young adults in the car were also staffers — they are currently in the hospital.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigkarAorrEsGWcp51ju6h7ypqlmqOloHqsrcypqmabkad6oq%2FCopuepqRigG63kWaqrqWdmr9uv9OanZ9lpJqurr%2BMoayrrF1meqWxwJ1kmp6kmr9uudSlq6Jlk5a%2Fbq3CnKCdnZ6peqq6jJqppJmeqK60ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
