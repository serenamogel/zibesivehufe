The victim, Lapattra, was apparently at YoungBoy's Houston home. Now, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bossip</a> has reported that if Yaya is convicted of the alleged crime, she could face up to 99 years in prison on top of a $10,000 fine. Kurt Schaffer has been hired to defend YaYa against the Harris County District Attorney’s Office. It is also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reported </a>that YaYa is planning to plead 'not guilty' when she has to report to the courts in August 2020.</p><p>Schaffer has been known to have successfully defended J Prince in a case that accused him of giving out the order to have Ronnie Bookman to be jumped in 2007 in a fight that involved the selling of ownership stakes in a local recording studio. Schaffer <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">successfully</a> defended J Prince, the founder and CEO of Houston’s Rap-a-Lot Records, in a case accusing him of ordering Ronnie Bookman to be jumped in 2007 at a gym complex he owned, because Bookman refused to sell his ownership stake in a local recording studio, according to news reports from that time.</p><p>YaYa is also facing serious charges, as police say that the 19-year-old stabbed Lapattra Jacobs following a verbal confrontation inside her fiance NBA YoungBoy’s Houston home, the argument then turned physical. It was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> that when the fight moved to the kitchen and YaYa had picked up two knives that she used to stab Lapattra when she moved toward her. YaYa <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reportedly</a> stabbed Lapattra with the first knife after charging at her. Lapattra had <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">told</a> officers that she was unable to feel the first stab wound, but was stabbed again by Yaya with the second knife. The victim was on the floor when the ambulance arrived at the scene.</p><p>NBA YoungBoy, who seems to have not been actively involved in the altercation, was said to be home at the time. He was also temporarily handcuffed but was later released while his fiancee YaYa was taken to Harris County Jail.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRosZGurm65wLKunpmknbKzeZhyZLKdkafAbrzRoqqopl2owaKuw6ikmqGelIRuw86mmKdlnpeubsXOrqWgZZKkxm64wKmYrayilnqrrcKomaw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
