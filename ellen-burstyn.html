Burstyn won an Academy Award for her role.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the late 1950s, she landed her first regular acting gig, as a dancer on television’s The Jackie Gleason Show, billed as Erica Dean. She made her Broadway debut in 1957 in Fair Game, using the stage name Ellen McRae. She would keep that name for the next 10 years while working steadily on television in the daytime drama The Doctors (1964) and the western-themed series The Iron Horse (1966-68), as well as with minor film roles.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After changing her name yet again, this time to Ellen Burstyn, she landed what would become her breakthrough role, that of Lois Farrow in The Last Picture Show (1971), costarring Jeff Bridges and Cybill Shepherd. Her performance earned Burstyn her first Academy Award nomination, for Best Supporting Actress. Her second Oscar nod, this time for Best Actress, came two years later for her role in William Friedkin’s famed movie The Exorcist. Burstyn played Chris MacNeil, a middle-aged actor whose daughter (Linda Blair) is possessed by demonic forces.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1974, she produced and starred in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/martin-scorsese data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Martin Scorsese" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Martin Scorsese</a>’s emotional drama Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore. Burstyn pushed to have Scorsese in the director’s chair for the film after she watched his 1973 breakout movie Mean Streets. Her portrayal of a single mother struggling to support herself and her young son notched Burstyn a third Academy Award nomination, and this time she won the Best Actress prize.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">More Best Actress Oscar Winners</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In addition to her triumphs on screen, Burstyn took home a Tony Award in 1975 for her performance opposite Charles Grodin in Same Time, Next Year.

Also in 1982, she and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/al-pacino data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Al Pacino" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Al Pacino</a> succeeded Lee Strasberg as co-artistic directors of the Actors Studio. Burstyn served in the Actors Studio post for the next six years (Pacino stepped down in 1984).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Throughout the 1980s, she also built up a considerable resume of acclaimed television roles and series, beginning in 1981 with her Emmy-nominated performance in the fact-based miniseries The People vs. Jean Harris. In addition to such dramatic TV movies as Surviving (1985), Into Thin Air (1985), and the Emmy-nominated Pack of Lies (1987), Burstyn tried her hand at comedy with her own series, The Ellen Burstyn Show (1986-87).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Burstyn acted in a steady stream of TV movies in the ’90s with her next series role starting in 2000 on the CBS drama That’s Life. The show followed a 32-year-old bartender, played by Heather Dubrow, who breaks off her engagement and decides to go to college. Burstyn played Dubrow’s onscreen busybody mother for the series’ two seasons.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Guest roles in the late 2000s proved to be more fruitful ground. Burstyn had a recurring guest role on the HBO hit Big Love, which earned her a 2008 Emmy Award nomination. The next year, she won an Emmy for her guest appearance on the crime drama Law & Order: SVU. (She reprised the role in several episodes of Law & Order: Organized Crime as recently as May 2023.)</p><img alt="ellen burstyn smiles and looks to the left of the camera, she holds her emmy award while standing next to a table with a purple tablecloth, she wears a cream, tan and gold caftan" title="Ellen Burstyn in September 2013" width=4928 height=3280 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/actress-ellen-burstyn-winner-of-the-best-supporting-actress-news-photo-1693950485.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Ellen Burstyn has won two Emmy Awards, most recently in 2013 for her supporting role on Political Animals.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Burstyn continued to thrive on the small screen in the next decade.
