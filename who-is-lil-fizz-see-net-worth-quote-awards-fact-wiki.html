Known under his stage name of Lil’ Fizz, he is an actor and hip hop artist, which activities are the main sources of his net worth, and rose to fame as a member of R&B band B2K. As of today, he is the star of the reality television show “Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood” (2014–present). He debuted in the entertainment industry at the beginning of the 21st century, in 2000.</p><p>How much is the net worth of Lil’ Fizz? It has been reported that the outright size of his wealth is as much as $2 million, accumulated during a career so far spanning 15 years.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=lil-fizz-net-worth-2-million></span>Lil’ Fizz Net Worth $2 Million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Lil’ Fizz debuted in the entertainment industry as the member of the band B2K, which meant Boys of the new Millennium, produced by Chris Stokes. The band’s successful first releases were two popular studio albums: “B2K” (2002) which topped the Billboard R&B Top receiving gold certificate according to the sales in USA, and “Pandemonium!” (2002) which peaked in third position of the previously mentioned chart, achieving platinum and silver certificates respectively in the USA and UK. In 2004, all the members of B2K starred in the feature film “You Got Served” , directed by their manager, Chris Stokes. The film received poor reviews but was financially profitable, as the box office grossed $48.6 million with the budget of just $8 million. It is worth mentioning that the soundtrack album released under the same name as the film was also very successful. It peaked in 2nd position on the Billboard Sound Albums, and received gold certification for sales in the USA. Although it was reported that the band split up because of internal disagreements in 2004, this period was a significant source of Lil’ Fizz’s net worth.</p><p>Following the breakup of the band, Lil’ Fizz pursued a solo career. He is known for releasing five singles (“Fluid” (2006) with Missez, “Beds” (2007) featuring Ray J, “Bounce” (2009) with J-Boog, “Becky” (2013) and “Famous” (2014) featuring Fresco Kane), and a studio album “Payday” (2007). Fizz is also co-founder of the record label Popular Entertainment. Thus, music is an important source of Lil’ Fizz net worth.</p><p>To add more, Fizz has increased his net worth appearing on television and cinema screens. Talking about the feature films, he landed roles in three of them, including the previously mentioned “You Got Served”, and two more films, “Steppin: The Movie” (2009) directed and produced by Michael Taliferro and “Hype Nation 3D” (2014) directed by Alan Calzatti and Christian A. Strickland. His television appearances have included the sketch comedy show “All That” (2002), the sitcom “The War at Home” (2005 – 2007) created by Rob Lotterstein, and starring in the reality series “Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood” (2014–present); the latter focuses on the lives of people from the hip hop industry living in the Hollywood area.</p><p>Concerning the personal life of the rapper, Fizz was in a long time relationship with Moniece Slaughter, and they have a son named Kamron David Frederic who was born in 2010.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><table><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Lil’ Fizz</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$2 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>November 26, 1985</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>New Orleans, Louisiana, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.70&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Songwriter, Record producer, Actor, Rapper</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Kameron Frédéric</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Dreux Pierre Frederic , John Pierre Frédéric , Fizz , Fizzo</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td>http://www.twitter.com/airfizzo</td></tr><tr><td>MySpace</td><td>http://www.myspace.com/fizzoo</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>www.imdb.com/name/nm1212896</td></tr><tr><td>Music Groups</td><td>B2K</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>You Got Served</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood</td></tr></table><table class=quotes><tr><th>Quote</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>If I could be any animal, it would be a chameleon so I could blend in with everything.</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts><tr><th>Fact</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>He and his other two band members have recently departed from former B2k member Omarion.
