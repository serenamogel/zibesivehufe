When they married, the family name was Jacobs, but by the time Tony's brother Robert was born in 1945, the family name had changed to Jay. His family were Jewish.</p><span>1953</span><p>Tony Jay attended Pinner County Grammar School, and completed his National <a href=#>Service</a> with the Royal Air Force in 1953. He later recalled, "I was always an actor at school"; but opted for the financial security of a real estate <a href=#>Business</a>. Jay and his first wife moved to South <a href=#>Africa</a> in about 1966, after hearing of the potential there for his line of work. He left South <a href=#>Africa</a> to return to <a href=#>England</a> in 1973, after which he moved to the United States in 1986.</p><span>1967</span><p>In various animated projects Jay took over the voice of Shere Khan, which actor George Sanders had originated for the 1967 Disney animated film <i>The Jungle Book</i>. In 11 episodes spanning 1990â€“91, Jay voiced Shere Khan for Disney's animated TV series <i>TaleSpin</i>, <i>The Jungle Book: Rhythm and Groove</i> videogame (2000), and the <i>House of Mouse</i> (2001â€“02). His final appearance as Khan came in the 2003 film <i>The Jungle Book 2</i>. His final role was voicing Spiderus in the <i>Miss Spider</i> series.</p><span>1971</span><p>Jay acted, wrote, and directed radio plays on the South <a href=#>African</a> Broadcasting Corporation's first commercial radio station, Springbok Radio (1950â€“85). He was especially associated with the comic series <i>Taxi!</i> (1969-1972,1975-1978), in which he not only portrayed New York cabby Red Kowalski, but also co-wrote many scripts with Joe Stewardson. Other shows in which he was involved included <i>Lux Radio Theatre</i>, <i>Playhouse 90</i>, and <i>Tuesday Theatre</i>. Jay adapted, cast, and directed the first 6 months of episodes for <i>The Avengers</i>. The series, based on Seasons 4-6 of the 1960s <a href=#>British</a> television series of the same name, was broadcast on Springbok from 6 December 1971 to 28 December 1973. To bridge the gap between the visual orientation of the <a href=#>British</a> television series and the sound-only perspective of radio, Jay created a narrator which he embued with irony and scepticism.</p><span>1973</span><p>After Jay's return to <a href=#>England</a> in 1973 he worked in various television productions. For the BBC series <i>Fall of Eagles</i> (1974) he portrayed Tsar Alexander III of <a href=#>Russia</a>, during which time he met Patrick Stewart, who played Vladimir Lenin.

More important roles followed with an appearance as Jaggers in <i>Great Expectations</i> (1984) at the Old Vic, and as Shylock in <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>.</p><span>1986</span><p>During its run from August to October 1986 at the Broadhurst Theatre on Broadway, Jay's performance was described as "brilliantly played" by the <i>New York Times</i>. Consequently, he was nominated for the 1987 Drama Desk Award as Outstanding Featured Actor in a Play.</p><span>1988</span><p>He wed <i>Married With Children</i> make-up <a href=#>Artist</a> Kathy Rogers in 1988, and they had a son, Adam, in December that year. In 2004 he married Marta MacGeraghty.</p><span>1991</span><p>Jay's voice-over work included Monsieur D'Arque, the amoral asylum superintendent, in Disney's 1991 hit animated film version of <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>. From 1994â€“2001 he supplied the voice for the virus Megabyte in the computer animated television show <i>ReBoot</i>. According to one source, Jay was preferred to Patrick Stewart, Derek Jacobi, Ian McKellen for the voice of Judge Claude Frollo in Disney's 1996 animated film adaptation of <i>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</i>, directed by <a href=#>Gary Trousdale</a> and Kirk Wise, who had also steered his performance in the film version of <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>. Jay reprised Frollo's voice for Walt Disney World's nighttime light and fireworks show <i>Fantasmic!</i> From 1995 to 1996 Jay was the voice of the alien warlord Lord Dregg, the villain during the last two seasons of the original 1987 <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i> animated TV series.</p><span>1993</span><p>Jay also made many distinguished on-screen appearances, including the role of Nigel St John on <i>Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman</i> (1993â€“1995). He further made guest appearances on programs including <i>The Golden Girls</i> in 1987, <i>Twin Peaks</i> in 1990-91, and <i>Night Court</i> in 1991. His most prominent onscreen role, however, is that of Professor Werner in <i>Twins</i> (1988), the mentor to Arnold Schwarzenegger's protagonist, Julius Benedict.</p><span>1996</span><p>He is also well-known among fans of the 1996â€“2003 video game series <i>Legacy of Kain</i> for his voicing of the original Mortanius and of the Elder God, alongside several other minor characters.</p><span>2005</span><p>Jay was a devotee of classic Broadway and made several recordings and performances of old-time Broadway lyrics, in spoken-word form. A CD of these readings, <i>Speaking of Broadway</i>, was released in 2005; a version recorded in 1996 was entitled <i>Poets on Broadway</i>, as was his website. On it Jay recites lyrics written by the likes of NoÃ«l Coward, Ira Gershwin, and Oscar Hammerstein, accompanied by synthesized music which he composed.</p><span>2006</span><p>In April 2006 Jay underwent surgery in Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (Los Angeles) to remove a non-cancerous tumor from his lungs. Afterwards he became critically ill and was readmitted to Cedar Sinai, where he died on August 13, 2006, aged 73.
