It’s an unanswerable question, of course (even if the right answer is obviously Reese’s). There are so many different confectionary concoctions out there that to pick merely one would be an impossible challenge (except, of course, in the case of Reese’s). However, one <a href=#>candy bar</a> that is undoubtedly in the top tier is Snickers. Peanut allergies aside, you’re usually pretty stoked if you get one of these in your Halloween bucket.&nbsp;</p><p>So, let’s answer some questions about this grade A candy and learn everything there is to know about SNICKERS (it’s often styled in all-caps like this but it kind of makes it look like I’m yelling at you so I’m not going to do that).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-owns-snickers><strong>Who owns Snickers?</strong></h2><p>So you’re wondering who makes Snickers, eh? Well, you may not be all that surprised by the answer. Snickers is a product of Mars, one of the most iconic candy companies in the world. They’re the folks behind M&Ms, Twix, and Skittles, too, among many other products. According to their website, they’re “Family-owned. Future-facing. Purpose-driven.” Okay!&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-when-was-snickers-invented><strong>When was Snickers invented?</strong></h2><p>Snickers were first rolled out in 1930. And here’s a fun fact that you probably didn’t know: They are named after the Mars family’s favorite horse, Snickers. I think we can all agree that Snickers is a good name for a candy and a great name for a horse. Well done, Mars family.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-are-snickers-made><strong>Where are Snickers made?</strong></h2><p>Mars, Inc has a large Snickers manufacturing plant in Waco, TX, and millions upon millions of Snickers bars have been produced there. However, because Mars is a gigantic, multinational corporation, they operate in over 80 countries and have manufacturing facilities all over the place.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-in-a-snickers><strong>What is in a Snickers?</strong></h2><p>The short answer is nougat, peanuts, and caramel covered in chocolate. But to get more technical, let’s take a peek at the ingredients label, shall we? A Snickers bar contains the following: Milk Chocolate (Sugar, Cocoa Butter, Chocolate, Skim Milk, Lactose, Milkfat, Soy Lecithin), Peanuts, Corn Syrup, Sugar, Palm Oil, Skim Milk, Lactose, Salt, Egg Whites, Artificial Flavor. CONTAINS PEANUTS, MILK, EGG AND SOY. MAY CONTAIN TREE NUTS. Sorry for the yelling again. I’m just being faithful to the Snickers label.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-do-snickers-have-peanuts><strong>Do Snickers have peanuts?</strong></h2><p>Yes, one of the classic components of a Snickers is a hearty helping of peanuts. That means if you have peanut allergies of any kind, you’ll most likely want to steer clear of this candy bar.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-are-snickers-gluten-free><strong>Are Snickers gluten free?</strong></h2><p>Technically speaking, Snickers is a gluten-free candy bar. However, they are not labeled thusly, which can cause some confusion. It’s possible that Snickers may contain some gluten cross-contamination from the plant where they were manufactured, so be sure to proceed with caution if you’re trying to avoid any trace of gluten whatsoever.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-long-is-a-snickers-bar><strong>How long is a Snickers bar?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>So, as it turns out, this was a little bit of a challenging question to answer. Unfortunately at the moment I have neither a ruler nor a Snickers bar at hand, so I cannot independently verify any claims. According to one <a href=# rel=noopener>blog</a>, a Snickers bar measures in at just under four inches. According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Amazon’s</a> info on a single Snickers bar, the length is 4.4 inches. To get a definitive answer here, I encourage you to grab a ruler and bring it to your nearest convenience store, then let us know your findings in the comments.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKuenrCssdGsZJ%2BZoWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
