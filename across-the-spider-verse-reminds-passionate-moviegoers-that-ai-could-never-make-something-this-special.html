It powers our cars, our homes, our gadgets and gizmos, and it might even generate our entertainment years down the line. But that doesn’t sound as awe-inspiring as it should, especially since this same revolutionary idea will eventually lead to several animators losing work to robots — such is the fear of our nation as every day passes. Even at the drive-thru, on live chat websites, and taking phone calls, automated messages and recordings are everywhere. There’s no escaping technology as it slowly overruns the globe and replaces the irreplaceable talent of human beings.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=498 data-current-count=498 data-injectable=true>But as much as it might be integrated into our lives, technology won’t ever overthrow the authenticity of hard work and talent, as proven by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Across the Spider-Verse</strong></a>, which is already being called one of animation’s greatest triumphs. This bold statement opened discourse on social media as to whether or not AI — an up-and-coming form of creating content online — could replicate the same mind-blowing graphics as hand-drawn storyboards. The answer is a resounding “no.”</p><p data-characters=424 data-current-count=424 data-injectable=true>The Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse trilogy uses a blend of hand-drawn and computer-generated animation to produce the desired “cartoony” effect that’s become synonymous with Miles Morales’ animated ventures. Although some parts use digital art, there isn’t a single trace of AI influence to be found; all of the animation is produced by hard-working animators, nothing more and nothing less.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>friendly reminder that <a href=#>#AcrossTheSpiderverse</a> is made by REAL HUMAN ARTISTS and there is no way the involvement of AI could’ve achieved what they achieved, ORIGINALITY <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/CwfS21EuK6</a></p>— nicodaboy (@nicodaboy_) <a href=#>June 2, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Across The Spider-Verse gives me so much hope against the looming threat of generative AI.</p><p>No machine could envision this.</p><p>No program could create it.</p><p>Nothing but the chaotic creative power of hundreds of passionate people could bring something so powerful and beautiful to us. <a href=#>https://t.co/K9rrRvpMa0</a></p>— CarmenSinek_Final_SuperFinal3.psd (@CarmenSinek) <a href=#>June 2, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://twitter.com/Ethanle03Le/status/1664495108404965381?s=20</figure><p data-characters=543 data-current-count=843 data-injectable=true>Right now, generative AI is a looming threat in today’s society as it’s found the capability to write essays, make artwork and act weirdly similar to a real human — which is just plain uncomfortable. This is causing issues for students, who are becoming lazy and using AI to hand in their work, as well as artists, who are losing commissions to AI-generated art. There are also instances where AI can be used to converse with others or formulate sentences for a given situation, so the art of conversation is well and truly dead.</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=235 data-injectable=false>At least they’ll never be able to take Spider-Man from us, especially not if Beyond the Spider-Verse ends up being as jaw-dropping as the sequel. All we need to fight back against AI is a strong, durable, and untouchable trilogy.</p><p data-characters=117 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false>Enjoy the beauty of hand-drawn animation for yourself.
