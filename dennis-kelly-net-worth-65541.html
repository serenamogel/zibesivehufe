Staged at Theatre 503 in 2003, it transferred the next year to Battersea Arts Centre. It was well received and he went on to write the controversially titled <i>Osama the Hero</i> which was produced by Hampstead Theatre, beginning a long-running relationship with the theatre.</p><span>2005</span><p>He wrote <i>After the End</i> in 2005. It was produced by Paines Plough in his first out of London production at the Traverse, though it later came to the Bush Theatre before going on a tour of the UK and internationally in 2006.</p><span>2006</span><p><i>Love and Money</i> was staged at the Royal Exchange, Manchester and then at the Young Vic in 2006. That same year his sitcom <i>Pulling</i>, co-written and starring Sharon Horgan, aired on BBC Three. It received good ratings for the channel and was well reviewed, being nominated for a BAFTA TV Award for Best Situation Comedy in 2007.</p><span>2007</span><p>Kelly said that writing for TV and theatre is very unusual as <i>Pulling</i> is a comedy and not theatrical unlike his plays which are serious and often non-naturalistic. Kelly said <i>"telling people from the world of TV that I also inhabit the world of theatre is something I've begun to avoid."</i><br>Despite very good reviews and good ratings <i>Pulling</i> was cancelled in 2007. The decision by the BBC was much criticised and Kelly and Horgan claimed to have cried and threw themselves at their feet over the decision. Most striking about Pulling is its lack of a moral centre. In an interview with The Guardian Horgan said <i>"I guess there isn't a moral centre because Dennis and I don't have one."</i> Kelly then said <i>"That's scary. Fuck. We need to get a moral centre. Shit. It's really true. But we do try to make sure we don't get nasty for the sake of it. We make sure there's a bit of heart. "</i></p><span>2008</span><p>The second series of <i>Pulling</i> ran in 2008 and won a <a href=#>British</a> Comedy Award. However, the show was not renewed for a third series, although in 2009 an hour-long special closed the series. That same year he also wrote an episode for Series 8 of <i>Spooks</i>.</p><span>2009</span><p>In 2009, his play <i>Orphans</i> was staged at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre before transferring to the Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh as part of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.</p><span>2010</span><p>In 2010, Kelly returned to the Hampstead Theatre once more for his response to Shakespeare's King Lear, <i>The Gods Weep</i> starring Jeremy Irons, with mixed reviews. His next theatrical venture fared much better; his musical version of Roald Dahl's <i>Matilda</i> co-written with <a href=#>Comedian</a> Tim Minchin was a hit at the RSC in 2011. It transferred to the West End and has won several awards including Best Musical at the Evening Standard Awards, The Critics' Circle and Theatre Awards.</p><span>2015</span><p>On 9 November 2015, Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts awarded both Kelly and <i>Matilda</i> co-collaborator Tim Minchin an Honorary Doctorate in letters, validated by the University of East Anglia, for their work on <i>Matilda the Musical</i>.</p><span>2017</span><p>He wrote an adaptation of <i>Pinocchio</i> featuring the songs and score from the Walt Disney film for the National Theatre, opening in December 2017.</p><span>2018</span><p>Amazon announced in February 2018 that Kelly will adapt <a href=#>Iain Banks</a>' <i>Consider Phlebas</i> for TV.</p><span>2019</span><p>His work has been produced in <a href=#>Germany</a>, <a href=#>Austria</a>, <a href=#>Switzerland</a>, <a href=#>Slovakia</a>, the <a href=#>Netherlands</a>, <a href=#>Ireland</a>, <a href=#>Iceland</a>, the Czech Republic, <a href=#>Bulgaria</a>, <a href=#>Poland</a>, Italy, <a href=#>Australia</a>, Japan, the United States, <a href=#>Belgium</a>, <a href=#>Denmark</a>, <a href=#>Romania</a> and <a href=#>Canada</a>. Other work includes translations of PÃ©ter KÃ¡rpÃ¡tiâ€™s <i>Fourth Gate</i> (National Theatre Studio) and <i>The Colony</i>, a radio play which won Best European Radio Drama at the Prix Europa, 2004.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.idolnetworth.com/images/play_game.png alt="More or less Game" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <a href=# class=btn>Play Game</a><h2>Tags:</h2><a href=#>British dramatists and playwrights</a> <a href=#>English dramatists and playwrights</a> <a href=#>English television writers</a> <a href=#>1970 births</a> <a href=#>Living people</a> <a href=#>Alumni of Goldsmiths, University of London</a> <a href=#>People from Chipping Barnet</a> <a href=#>British male screenwriters</a> <a href=#>Writers from London</a> <a href=#>Drama Desk Award winners</a> <a href=#>Tony Award winners</a> <a href=#>Showrunners</a> <a href=#>English male dramatists and playwrights</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeUmruvtdJmop6knK56r7HTZq6oqqSdeneBlG1o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
