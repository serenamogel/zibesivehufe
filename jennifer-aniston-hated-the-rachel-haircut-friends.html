But no matter where her career takes her, she remains grateful for her Friends roots.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"I miss a lot about that time. Having a job that was absolute, pure joy,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instyle.com/celebrity/jennifer-aniston-anniversary-issue data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she told InStyle" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">she told InStyle</a> in 2019. “I miss getting to be with people I love massively and respect beyond words.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Despite that tug, there’s one thing she clearly doesn’t miss about the time — "The Rachel." “How do I say this?”<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.allure.com/gallery/jennifer-aniston data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" she told Allure" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> she told Allure</a>. “I think it was the ugliest haircut I’ve ever seen.”</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Aniston's longtime hairstylist came up with 'The Rachel'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Although the hairstyle became a major symbol of the show, it wasn’t a calculated move, per se.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“I first created 'The Rachel' back when I met Jennifer, which was more than 20 years ago,” hairstylist Chris McMillan <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/beauty/hair/stylist-chris-mcmillan-how-creating-the-rachel-changed-his-life/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told The Telegraph" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">told The Telegraph</a>. “Back then, Jennifer had really long hair with a fringe.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The show was in the middle of its hugely successful first season, but McMillan thought maybe it was time to change things up. “I told her she should grow her fringe out, get some highlights and just try something a bit different,” he continued. “We cut the length and added in all these layers to blend the bottom to the bangs — and the rest is history.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The fresh look was a welcome change. “Her initial reaction was great, she loved it then,” McMillan said. “It was a really fun cut and different to anything else around at the time.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As for Aniston, she <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/style/jennifer-aniston-throwback-friends-photo-chris-mcmillan/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="said at the 2018 InStyle Awards" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">said at the 2018 InStyle Awards</a>: “I got that haircut and was like, ‘Wow this is amazing,’ and then I was totally left with this frizzy mop on my head, because I had no idea how to do what he did.”</p><img alt="Jennifer Aniston Courteney Cox Lisa Kudrow" title="Jennifer Aniston Courteney Cox Lisa Kudrow" width=2407 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-138426483.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty Images via Getty Images</span><p>L-R: Courteney Cox, Jennifer Aniston and Lisa Kudrow</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Fans and celebrities tried to mimic the haircut</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">What Aniston discovered right away was also what fans around the world quickly found out — although it looks simple and chic, the style was quite challenging to recreate.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“'The Rachel' was high maintenance,” Aniston told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/hair/a7749/hair-majesty-jennifer-aniston/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Marie Claire" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Marie Claire</a>. “I'd curse Chris every time I had to blowdry. It took three brushes — it was like doing surgery!”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hair salons across the United States started getting an overwhelming demand for the cut — and across the pond, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/177204/Jennifer-Aniston-s-a-cut-above-for-11-million-women data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="11 million British women" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">11 million British women</a> admitted to having tried the look.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">And it wasn’t just fans that wanted to get Rachel’s locks. Other celebrities, ranging from <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/savannah-guthrie data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Savannah Guthrie" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Savannah Guthrie</a> to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/selena-gomez data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Selena Gomez" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Selena Gomez</a>, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.allure.com/story/selena-gomez-the-rachel-hairstyle data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="modeled their own locks" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">modeled their own locks</a> after Aniston’s waitress-turned-fashion executive character.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Even other sitcoms at the time wanted a piece of the popularity. Will & Grace star Debra Messing told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/10/178199/debra-messing-the-rachel-hair data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Refinery 29" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Refinery 29</a> that she tried out the look in the '90s. “Partway through the series, when Friends was also on TV, we were like, ‘Wait a minute, look at Jennifer Aniston's hair — everyone loves it,’” she recalled. “They said, ‘Maybe we should try and make you look like her.’ So I went to Jennifer’s hairstylist and got the cut.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Even though McMillan himself cut Messing's hair, the actress’ team back at Will & Grace still couldn’t get it quite right. “It was a whole debacle when we tried to do it on the show,” she continued. “They literally tried for three hours to straighten my hair like hers. It was so full and poofy that it looked like a mushroom. The whole thing was just a disaster, so [the producers] decided to just keep it curly.”</p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Aniston calls the cut 'cringe-y'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While wannabe trend-followers soon found the difficulties, McMillan revealed the secrets to The Telegraph. “It was an easy cut, but it needed regular trims to keep the layers looking sharp,” he said. “It’s high-maintenance, not a wash-and-go style.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That was the part that frustrated Aniston as well. “Honestly, even during that time, I couldn't do it on my own,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.glamour.com/story/jennifer-aniston-hated-the-rachel-cut data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she told Glamour" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">she told Glamour</a>. “I needed Chris attached to my hip. Left to my own devices, I am not skilled with a hairbrush and blow-dryer.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">And it’s because of the detailed complications that Aniston declared to Glamour: “I was not a fan of the 'Rachel.' That was kind of cringe-y for me.”</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The iconic haircut went against Aniston's style preferences</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The actress admits she looked up to a different TV icon’s hairstyle. “As a youngster, I was a big fan of Valerie Bertinelli's hair,” she told Glamour. But on her own, she prefers “long, natural-looking beachy waves — that feels most like me.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After all, her go-to hairstyle requires simple maintenance. “I’ll wash it, brush it, then put styling cream in and let it air-dry on its own,” Aniston added.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">And if there’s any question just how much she detests "The Rachel," the radio hosts of The Kyle and Jackie O Show <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/jennifer-aniston-would-rather-shave-her-head-than-have-the-rachel-cut-again-2013138/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="asked her in 2013" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">asked her in 2013</a> if she’d rather sport the Friends style for the rest of her life or shave her head one time. “Shave my hair once, definitely,” she replied defiantly.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ultimately, as perfect as the locks were for her, Aniston and the iconic hairstyle just weren’t a happy match. As she told Allure, “I love Chris and he’s the bane of my existence at the same time because he started that damn 'Rachel,' which was not my best look.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGikqK6ZmsBuwNVooZ6mnp6zpr6MmqWiq6Sku260wK2cnWWknbJuvsCcn56kXZ2uqr7CrqtmnqKesq%2Bw0g%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
