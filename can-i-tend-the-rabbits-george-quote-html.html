Among the benefits is the pleasure he will have from touching soft small creatures. Other reasons include the fact that, as the person in charge of caring for the rabbits, he is also the one in charge of killing the rabbits after they have grown large enough to consume.</p><p></p><h3>In a similar vein, George, could you tell me more about the rabbits?</h3><p>“Tell me about the rabbits,” Lennie says to his pal George when he becomes despondent while on their dismal escapade and wants a pick-me-up. “Tell me about the rabbits,” he says, in allusion to the rabbit farm that Lennie and George would one day possess.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>What exactly does Lennie have to say about the bunnies?</h3><p>Informing Lennie about the bunnies, he expresses his gratitude and pledges that no one will ever be nasty to him again.</p><p></p><h3>There were a total of 10 related question answers found.</h3><p></p><h3>What was the reason for the ban on Of Mice and Men?</h3><p>The novel Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck is on the American Library Association’s list of prohibited works on a regular basis. In addition to its obscenity and racism, it has also been prohibited due of its depiction of female characters. There is no indication that the problems will fade with time; even in the twenty-first century, the book is still being contested.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>What is the name of Curley’s wife?</h3><p>Her identity is determined by her position as Curley’s wife or Curley’s property. George and Candy refer to her by a variety of nicknames, including “jailbait” and “tart.” She overdoes the cosmetics and dresses in a “whore” manner, complete with crimson fingernails and red heels embellished with ostrich feathers. Lennie is entranced by her and can’t seem to take his gaze away from her.</p><p></p><h3>What motivated Lennie to murder Curley’s wife?</h3><p>He has accidently killed the dog by caressing it too hard, and he is concerned that George will discover this and prevent him from caring for the rabbits when they move into their new home, so he attempts to conceal the body behind some straw to avoid being discovered. Curley’s wife walks in and attempts to converse with Lennie.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Is Lennie a black person?</h3><p>He has a dark face with “restless eyes” and “sharp, powerful features,” including a “narrow, bony nose.” He also has “restless eyes” and “sharp, strong features.” Lennie Small is a mentally challenged, but enormous and physically powerful guy who travels with George and serves as his constant companion on his journey. To him, living off the lan’ and being able to care for rabbits are two of his greatest ambitions.</p><p></p><h3>What is the significance of the title Of Mice and Men?</h3><p>1) What was the inspiration behind Steinbeck’s choice of the title Of Mice and Men? According to Steinbeck, he picked the title Of Mice and Men after reading a poem by Robert Burns entitled “To a Mouse,” in which the author expresses remorse for accidently destroying a mouse’s nest.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>What exactly does George do after he assasinates Lennie?</h3><p>To get away from the monotony of their jobs, Lennie and George dream of buying a farm to share with their family. However, in the conclusion of the novella, George is compelled to assassinate Lennie when Lennie murders the wife of Curley. After murdering Lennie, George would never be able to realise his ambition of living on the farm.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153 data-inserter-version=2></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiZ3xxfo6cmKdlmWLBprrDZquhnV2nrqOuyK2qZp%2BVpL%2BosYyqrKislWO1tbnL</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
