Every season hosts at least one such free event, whether it's the Festival of the Lost or <a href=#>The Dawning</a>. Guardian Games is one of these free seasonal events in Destiny 2 that works slightly differently from the other events.</p><p>Bungie has now officially revealed more details about Guardian Games 2023. With <a href=#>Season of Defiance</a> story arc coming to an end, Destiny players will have new challenges and rewards to look forward to soon. Here's everything players need to know about Guardian Games 2023, including its start time, event card, rewards, and more.&nbsp;</p><h2>Destiny 2 Guardian Games 2023: Start Time</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/5y7gezfweWNRgywuZcjqBa6-9h5C1QD0H-8w8ohK7ww/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9EZXN0aW55XzIvZ3VhcmRpYW5nYW1lcy9ndWFyZGlhbmdhbWVzZGVzdGlueTItNC5qcGc><p>Guardian Games 2023 kicks off on <strong>2nd May</strong> and will end with Season of Defiance on 23rd May.&nbsp; As with every year, this year's event will also continue for three weeks.&nbsp;</p><h2>Destiny 2 Guardians Games 2023: How To Play</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/gnx5nQkoWLjH-Ae4LiUsxaBVE797orHiCeViYTvK0h0/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9EZXN0aW55XzIvZ3VhcmRpYW5nYW1lcy9ndWFyZGlhbmdhbWVzZGVzdGlueTIuanBn><p>Unlike other Destiny 2 seasonal events, Guardians Games doesn't add new activities for players to complete. Instead, players earn medallions by playing any activity (Strikes, Crucibles, Gambit, etc.), which they can turn into the Tower Podium to earn points for their class.</p><p>Activities such as Gambit, Quickplay Crucible, Vanguard playlists, Battleground, etc. reward Bronze and Silver Medallions. On the other hand, activities like Nightfalls, Raids, Dungeons, Competitive Crucible, Trials of Osiris, and Legend Defiant Battlegrounds reward Gold and Platinum Medallions.&nbsp;</p><p>Players can also earn Medallions from Contender Cards. Gold Card costs 1000 Glimmer and awards Gold Medallion, whereas Platinum Card costs 1500 Glimmer and awards Platinum Medallion. Players can only carry two of these at a time: one for Strikes and Gambit and the other for Crucible.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;As for new players, first, they must unlock The Tower and speak to Eva Levante in the Courtyard to gain access to the Guardian Games.</p><h2>Destiny 2 Guardian Games 2023: Rewards</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/cttBoH0n9W6smvxAbvVC3odi3hnBQ2pk366SE_Miecg/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9EZXN0aW55XzIvZ3VhcmRpYW5nYW1lcy90YXJheGlwcG9zc3RyYW5kc2NvdXRyaWZsZS5qcGc><p>In Guardians Games 2022, Bungie introduced a new Void SMG called The Title. It returns this year but with new perks like the Repulsor Brace. However, this year's Guardian Games featured weapon is the Taraxippos, a legendary Strand Scout Rifle (first of its kind.) Not much is known about this weapon, and Bungie is keeping its perk combination a secret for now.</p><h2>Guardian Games 2023 Strike changes explained&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/3pWPQWsHz81xxSr9EaOyc19uURrVGaQccP-_GzAyqfU/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9EZXN0aW55XzIvZ3VhcmRpYW5nYW1lcy93YXJsb2NrZ3VhcmRpYW5nYW1lcy5qcGc><p>Completing Strikes will reward players with Strike scores, which Bungie introduced in last year's Guardian Games. Earning high scores will unlock new powerful buffs for players to use in the Guardian Games playlists.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of playlists, there will be two Guardian Games playlists this year: the Guardian Games Ops Playlist and the Guardian Games Ops Competitive Playlist. The Ops Playlist will feature all the strikes that are currently available, whereas the Ops Competitive Playlist will have that week's Nightfall strike on the roll with modifiers and difficulty options. Like in previous years, players will have the option for regular matchmaking and class-based matchmaking.&nbsp;</p><h2>Guardian Games 2023 Crucible changes explained&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/btbj1KFCd1Nw4o490zcOPywLFHrr2Hc47qn4efO3zwI/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9EZXN0aW55XzIvZ3VhcmRpYW5nYW1lcy9odW50ZXJndWFyZGlhbmdhbWVzLmpwZw><p>Bungie is adding a new Crucible game mode for Guardian Games 2023 called Guardian Games: Supremacy. It will allow players to matchmake by class. For example, Hunters will matchmake with other Hunters to take a team of Warlocks or Titans.&nbsp;</p><p>In Supremacy, the key to winning a match is to collect class-branded crests, which every player who dies will leave behind. Players will have to recover these crests to earn points and defeat other classes. Winning matches will reward players with medallions, which they can deposit on the podium in the Tower to earn rewards.</p><h2>Guardian Games 2023 Event Card explained</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/HTjfktlh-_qj4imBLj_Z4TwIkj6vNYCH7xvPIqSBlls/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9EZXN0aW55XzIvZ3VhcmRpYW5nYW1lcy9ldmVudGNhcmRndWFyZGlhbmdhbWVzMjAyMy5qcGc><p>Like other seasonal events in Destiny 2 this past year, Bungie is adding an Event Card to Guardian Games 2023. The standard Event Card will be free-for-all players, which will allow them to complete challenges and obtain additional rewards like two new exotic emotes. Completing every challenge will also unlock the title "Champ." Players can also upgrade the Event Card for 1000 Silver for additional rewards.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, players who earned the title for all 2022's seasonal events like Solstice, Festival of the Lost, and The Dawning, and unlock the Champ title in Guardian Games 2023, will earn the Reveler title.&nbsp;</p><p>That's everything players need to know about Guardian Games 2023 in Destiny 2.</p><p>For more <a href=# rel=noopener>Destiny 2 news</a>, be sure to check out our dedicated section or take a look at some of our <a href=# rel=noopener>Guides & Tutorials</a>&nbsp;just below:</p><p><strong>Weekly Updates</strong></p><p><strong>Future Content</strong></p><p><strong>Best Hunter Builds</strong></p><p><strong>Best Titan Builds</strong></p><p><strong>Best Warlock Builds</strong></p><p><strong>Emblem & Shaders</strong></p><p><strong>Exotics, Catalyst & God Roll Guides</strong></p><p><strong>Game Guides</strong></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/8OOSmvsI81lP06JndyJhIOq8SWdCmFGwtRl4XDI0YhY/rs:fill:180:180:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi8xX1N0YWZmX1Bob3Rvcy9TaHJleXl5LmpwZw alt="Shreyansh Katsura" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Written by <a href=#>Shreyansh Katsura</a></h3><p>Shrey's obsession with analyzing, introspecting, and discussing every minute detail of video games brought him to game journalism.
