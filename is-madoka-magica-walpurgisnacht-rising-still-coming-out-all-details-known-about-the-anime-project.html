Recently, it released its Madoka Magica side story called <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Magia Record</a>, which featured a new set of magical girls and lasted for three seasons. So knowing that the franchise is still alive, has an official release date been announced for Madoka Magica: Walpurgisnacht Rising? Or has it been shelved for good?</p><h2 id=h-is-madoka-magica-walpurgisnacht-rising-still-coming-out data-injectable=false>Is ‘Madoka Magica: Walpurgisnacht Rising’ still coming out?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=422 data-current-count=722 data-injectable=true>When Madoka Magica: Walpurgisnacht Rising was announced during the franchise’s 10th anniversary celebration back in January 2021, fans were excited to see more of this magical girl story. However, considering the mixed reception that Magia Record received from fans, with a 6.8 rating on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MyAnimeList</a>, it’s safe to assume that the project may have been put on hold, especially given the lack of news since 2021.</p><p data-characters=513 data-current-count=513 data-injectable=true>At the moment, it’s currently unknown if the project is still in development or if it was shelved for good. An official release date has yet to be announced by Aniplex, Crunchyroll, or Shaft Studios. Meanwhile, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">movie’s official website</a> still has not released an official plot or synopsis. The only confirmed information is that the original voice actors from the Japanese dub of the anime will be reprising their roles and a simple logline which says “Let’s continue our story.”</p><p data-characters=483 data-current-count=483 data-injectable=true>Puella Magi Madoka Magica: Rebellion ended with Homura rewriting the universe, making Madoka no longer a magical girl and wiping everyone’s memories. However, Homura is aware that she will have to face Madoka at some point once she regains her memories. This ending led to a debate as to whether or not it was an ideal ending for the main Madoka Magica story, as some argued that the story should continue. Meanwhile, others claimed it was the perfect way for the story to end.</p><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=358 data-injectable=false>Hopefully, more information will be revealed at a later date. For now, fans can watch all seasons of Magia Record on Crunchyroll. Meanwhile, the original Puella Magi Madoka Magica series can be streamed on Hulu. Unfortunately, Rebellion is not available on any streaming platform, so it’s best to seek out a DVD copy or purchase it digitally on iTunes.</p><p data-characters=1 data-current-count=359 data-injectable=false></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6iqmalkZm8rK2MppigoZOWerity6msq5%2BZqLuir8etZKuho567qHnSraClpF2YvK61zaBkqK2kYq6tuIydnK2ZmaHAbrfNqK6nZZGXvLbAjK2fnmWRo7ausYypqaiilZjBcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
