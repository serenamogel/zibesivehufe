But what role will Fiona play in the story? What exactly are her motivations? Is she a friend or a foe? Those who donâ€™t read the manga are certainly curious about this development, and weâ€™re here to answer those questions.</p><h2 id=h-what-do-we-know-about-this-character data-injectable=false><strong>What do we know about this character?</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=698 data-injectable=true>Fiona Frost is a spy under WISE, the secret organization Loid Forger also works for. In fact, when Fiona first turned to the spying life, Loid was her mentor, training her and working alongside her for quite a while, which led to Fiona developing feelings for Loid. Often stone-faced and calculating, Agent Nightfall chooses to keep her emotions to herself, never giving away her romantic feelings.</p><p data-characters=510 data-current-count=510 data-injectable=true>Despite not being able to work directly with Loid on Operation Strix, Fiona is tasked with aiding her mentor as a secret informant, but that doesnâ€™t sit very well with her. While she wishes Loid well, Fionaâ€™s feelings for her spy companion start to get in the way as she meets Loidâ€™s make-believe family â€“ particularly Yor. You see, Agent Nightfall convinces herself that Yor Forger is not a suitable wife (even for a facade), and plots to remove her from the equation in order to take up Yorâ€™s role.</p><p data-characters=304 data-current-count=304 data-injectable=false>Fionaâ€™s animosity toward Yor muddles the waters&nbsp;when one tries to determine whether Agent Nightfall will remain Loidâ€™s ally or develop into an antagonist.
