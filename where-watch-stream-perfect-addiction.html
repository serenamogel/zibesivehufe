The story centers on MMA trainer Sienna Lane (Kiana Madeira) whose boyfriend Jax Deneris (Matthew Noszka) cheats on her with her sister Beth (Bree Winslow), Sienna sets out to get revenge against Jax by training his rival Kayden Williams (Ross Butler) to beat him in an upcoming fight. In the process, Sienna finds herself falling for Kayden. Perfect Addiction is based on the Wattpad story and book by Claudia Tan, and it was directed by Castille Landon, known for directing the final three movies in the After series (After We Fell, After Ever Happy, After Everything).</p><p>Perfect Addiction is far from the only movie based on a Wattpad novel. Wattpad is one of the most popular websites used by writers to self-publish stories and novels, and it is home to the stories that inspired both the Perfect Addiction movie and the <a href=#>After film series</a>.</p><h2 id=perfect-addiction-is-available-for-rent-on-prime-video-and-apple-tv>Perfect Addiction Is Available For Rent On Prime Video And Apple TV</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/perfect-addiction.jpg><p>The Perfect Addiction movie is available for rent on Prime Video and Apple TV, with platforms each charging $5.99 for the film. On both Prime Video and Apple TV, content can be rented for up to 30 days unwatched, but once a user starts watching, the content only remains in the user's library for 48 hours. Perfect Addiction is also available to rent on DirecTV, Google Play, YouTube, Vudu, Microsoft Store, Redbox, and Spectrum on Demand. Fans of Perfect Addiction can purchase a digital copy of the movie on Prime Video or Apple TV for $14.99, as well as on Google Play, YouTube, Vudu, Microsoft Store, and Redbox.</p><p>When Perfect Addiction was first released, it was available for streaming on Prime Video, but after a period of time it was removed and only available for rent or purchase. There has been no word that the Perfect Addiction movie will be removed from Prime Video or Apple TV's renting or buying libraries.</p><h2 id=will-the-perfect-addiction-movie-get-a-sequel>Will The Perfect Addiction Movie Get A Sequel</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ross-butler-in-perfect-addiction.jpg><p>Currently, there are no plans for a sequel to the Perfect Addiction movie. Perfect Addiction is actually the second book in Tan's Perfect series, and Perfect Illusion was the first book while Perfect Redemption was book three. Before Perfect Redemption, the books were part of an anthology series and did not have a connecting plot, but Perfect Redemption is a spin-off of Jax's life after Perfect Addiction.</p><p>Given that Perfect Redemption is about a character already seen in the Perfect Addiction movie, it would make sense for it to be the next book in the Perfect series to get a film adaptation. From the moment it was released on Wattpad, <strong>Perfect Addiction</strong> became immensely popular, which is likely why it was adapted over Perfect Illusion. The story focusing on Sienna gaining independence is ripe with modern feminist themes, and its sports elements add to its widespread appeal.</p>Related Topics About The Author<h3 class=section-title>Recommended Articles</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirk6eyprrRmqWtZpOkunDDx56pnmWnlsGktIysq6udkaJ6sbHRn5ycrF2WsaW1wq2gqKZf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
