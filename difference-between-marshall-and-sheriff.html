The town <b>marshals</b> and their deputies acted as peace officers in the towns. The county <b>sheriffs</b> were usually the highest elected official in the county and their jurisdiction was county-wide.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=whats-higher-than-a-sheriff></span>What’s higher than a sheriff?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The Chief Deputy <b>Sheriff</b> is the <b>highest</b> rank to which you can be appointed.

Although their exact numbers are kept classified, airline insiders estimate that only five percent of U.S. <b>flights</b> have an <b>air marshal</b> on board.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-a-us-marshal-vs-fbi></span>What is a US marshal vs FBI?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The <b>FBI</b>, or <b>Federal</b> Bureau of Investigation, is under the <b>U.S.</b> Department of Justice.

Also, <b>they can</b> transport skips across state lines without enduring extradition proceedings.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-the-most-wanted-man-in-america></span>Who is the most wanted man in America?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>YASER ABDEL SAID</b><ul class=i8Z77e><li class=TrT0Xe><b>Most Wanted</b>.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Fugitives.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Terrorism.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Kidnappings / Missing <b>Persons</b>.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Bank Robbers.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>ECAP.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>ViCAP.</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-the-most-famous-bounty-hunter></span>Who is the most famous bounty hunter?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>5 <b>famous bounty hunters</b></b><li class=TrT0Xe>John of the Priests.
