Speaking in an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Tonight</a>, Angela opened up about her views on her fellow cast members that were also at the couples’ retreat.</p><p data-characters=467 data-current-count=467 data-injectable=true>In particular, Angela took aim at “Big” Ed Brown and Liz Woods, discussing her thoughts about their relationship in-depth. The couple previously starred on season 7 of 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After?, and Ed was previously on 90 Day Fiancé: Before The 90 Days season 4, with then-girlfriend Rosemarie Vega. Big Ed has always been a controversial figure among 90 Day fans, and it seems like Angela has similarly mixed feelings about the on/off couple.</p><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=243 data-injectable=false>“I see Ed does this and he says Liz does this for a camera but actually, it’s both of them,” Angela told the outlet, implying that the couple may play up their drama for the show. “They love attention”, she added.</p><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=590 data-injectable=true>In a statement that may anger Ed, Angela called Ed “insecure”, and that Liz’s presence was a “security blanket” to mask his self-image. “Ed’s got an insecurity about his height and he’s got the little thing going on with his neck and he uses that as a security blanket to wear.” she explained.</p><p data-characters=273 data-current-count=273 data-injectable=false>However, Angela did state that Ed and Liz were the couple that best responded to treatment at the resort. She said Ed was “one of her favorites” of the cast. Addressing Ed directly, Angela stated “Liz loves you and I’ve seen that on the show.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e5hpZJ2ZqWKzqq3NnJxmrJiaeq2t0q1kq52jpL%2B1v4yapaCdnJZ6pbHEpmScqpmptqS12Z6qZp2UYq6vsIyloLNlo5bGtHnToZyyZZykw6Z5wK2rnqaknryvew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
