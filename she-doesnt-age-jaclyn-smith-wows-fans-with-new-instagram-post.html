The post was dedicated to her &#34;dear friend&#34;, Hollywood make-up artist, Patrick Foley."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She captioned the post: "I always love spending time with my dear friend @patrickseanf. He is a true friend, a friend that sees more in you than you see in yourself."</p><p>Smith added: "That's something you can't put a price on ... always offering insight, the right solution to whatever you are trying to solve. My forever friend who I love, and who I can always count on to make me laugh."</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>Fans quickly took to the comment section to express their shock at the 76-year-old's youthful complexion.</p><p>One said: "Most beautiful woman in the world," while another commented: "Still beautiful as ever."</p><p>One fan said: "looking so classically beautiful".</p><p>The mother of two made headlines last year after posting a snap with her 39-year-old son Gaston Richman and fans were fast to admit she looked younger than him.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>Speaking to Page Six, the star said at the time: "I'll tell you, it was a good photo."</p><p>"Right place, right time. That's the luck of the draw. Great lighting. I'm with a person that I adore, my son, and it was a going-away party, so my eyes were probably glistening with tears there, sparkling because he's one of the human beings I worship."</p><p>She continued to say she was flattered by the compliments, but the photo had a deeper meaning. "I love what that photo says to me," she explained. "It says, 'I'm the luckiest lady in the world to have a son like him.' As we know in pictures, they reflect what's going on inside of you, and that picture reflected every emotion I had at that moment."</p><p>Smith played Kelly Garrett in the hit Charlie's Angels series from 1976 to 1981 and reprised her role with a cameo in the 2003 Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle film alongside Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTAqbGMnaaeq56peqKzxGahmpucrrtuv8yiq6Flp6TEtHnFmqWsZaeewal5zZ6uZqGeqMGis9GapGaon6jBcJmsfoeNjnyNkZKWknx8fJJndqGFgKqBeZGRXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
