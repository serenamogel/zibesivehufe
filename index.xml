Speaking up against oppression against Black people when there were far fewer voices echoing yours meant you were always a target, like Harry and Harriette Moore, a married couple from Florida who counted themselves among the loudest voices of the early 1950s.

Of course, that's when the worst things tend to happen.</description></item><item><title>Marissa Smith Murder: A Tragic Incident in Louisville Park</title><link>/marissa-smith-murder-tragic-incident-louisville-park.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/marissa-smith-murder-tragic-incident-louisville-park.html</guid><description>On September 13, 2021, an altercation between two groups of teenagers in Louisville, Ohio, took a fatal turn when Marissa Grace Smith, a 17-year-old girl, fatally stabbed a 22-year-old man, Michael Devin Morris Jr. The incident occurred at Wildwood Park, where several teenagers had gathered to fight.&amp;nbsp;
