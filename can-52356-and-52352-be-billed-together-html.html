Immediately file a 52352 report if a physician inserts a stone basket via an endoscope in order to retrieve or manipulate a calculus In contrast, CPT code 52320 describes a technique that is almost identical to yours, with the exception of uretoscopy, which was also performed in your instance. Billing numbers 52356-LT and 52352-59,LT are thus suitable.
 In light of this, what exactly is procedure code 52356? Cystourethroscopy with ureteroscopy and/or pyeloscopy; with lithotripsy involving placement of indwelling ureteral stent) is not reimbursable with CPT codes 52332 and 52353 when done on the same side as CPT codes 52332 and 52353."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>
